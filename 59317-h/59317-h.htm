</div>

<p class='c006'>It must be borne in mind that this book
deals with principles and examples of methods
of warfare, and not fixed rules. There are no
fixed methods in warfare. Development in
warfare means change of methods or the
invention of new ones to overcome military
difficulties. However, one must have knowledge
of past and present methods to be ready
for the next logical step of development.</p>

</div>

<div class="section"></div>
<h3 class='c013'>I. Specialists</h3>

<p class='c014'>The exigencies of modern warfare, especially
of trench warfare, have developed new
infantry weapons. As there are several
kinds of these weapons to each infantry
company, the men detailed to handle them
must be trained as specialists. The weapons
are:</p>

<ul class='index'>
  <li class='c015'>Hand grenades</li>
  <li class='c015'>Rifle grenades</li>
  <li class='c015'>Automatic-machine rifles</li>
  <li class='c015'>Rifles</li>
</ul>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_2'>2</span>The men who use these weapons are respectively
known as:</p>

<ul class='index'>
  <li class='c015'>Hand grenadiers</li>
  <li class='c015'>Rifle grenadiers</li>
  <li class='c015'>A. M. R. crews</li>
  <li class='c015'>Riflemen</li>
</ul>

<p class='c008'>As a consequence of the new weapons, a
company is now organized on a basis of these
specialists. A typical company is patterned
like that of the French, the only difference
being in the number of specialists. Each of
the four platoons of a company contains the
same number of specialists and each platoon
is divided into four sections of specialists.</p>

<h4 class='c016'>Organization of a Typical Company</h4>

<p class='c014'>One lieutenant (1st and 4th platoons under
1st lieutenants; 2nd and 3rd platoons under
2nd lieutenants).</p>

<p class='c008'>One sergeant (second in command, assistant
to platoon commander).</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_4'>4</span>The platoon is the self-contained unit with
the proper proportion of all the different kinds
of specialists for the assault. The reason for
this is that the platoon is the largest unit that
one leader can control in combat. The four
platoons are alike and therefore interchangeable.</p>

<p class='c008'>Although it is true that the specialists are
particularly trained with their own weapons,
all men of the company are first trained as
riflemen. All specialists carry rifles, and if
for any reason they cannot use their special
weapon they immediately become riflemen.
Also every man is trained in hand grenade
throwing. This makes it possible to fill gaps
in the specialists’ ranks from the riflemen.
Some men also, usually to the number of the
A. M. R. crews, must be trained to operate
the automatic-machine rifles.</p>

<p class='c008'>The remaining supernumeraries of the company,
such as mess and supply sergeants,
mechanics, cooks, buglers, etc., do not march
with the company in maneuver or combat
formations. Some of the above supernumeraries
will be found in the captain’s headquarters,
or tactical group, such as the liaison
agents from the platoons, orderlies, buglers,
and observers. Mess and supply sergeants,
cooks, etc., remain with the regimental train
<span class='pageno' id='Page_5'>5</span>in rear, with the kitchen behind the artillery
positions. The tactical group of the captain
lives in an adjoining dugout to that of their
chief in the sector. In the fight these latter
are used as messengers or observers.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_6'>6</span>
  <h4 class='c016'>In the Defensive</h4>
</div>

<p class='c014'><b>Hand Grenades.</b> Hand grenades are used
to produce a short-range defensive barrage
at a distance of about 30 yards in front of
the trenches. For this purpose one grenade
thrower is required for from 10 to 16 yards
of frontage.</p>

<p class='c008'>They are also used to establish centers of
resistance; to protect important features of
the lines, such as salients, machine gun or
automatic rifle posts, command posts, listening
posts, etc.</p>

<p class='c008'>They are used to defend a barricade in a
communicating trench. In this latter case
the grenades may be thrown from a special
bombing post established for that purpose or
from an adjoining trench.</p>

<p class='c008'><b>Rifle Grenades.</b> Rifle grenades are employed
to establish a barrage at a greater
range than that of the hand grenade, being
used up to as great a distance as 300 yards.
The great advantage of the rifle grenade
barrage is that it is under the control of the
platoon leader and can be called into service
immediately, which is not always true of the
artillery barrage.</p>

<p class='c008'>Several grenade rifles concentrated on a
trench will stop hand grenade throwing from
<span class='pageno' id='Page_7'>7</span>the same. Rifle grenades are usually shot
from the cover trench immediately in rear
of the fire trench.</p>

<p class='c008'><b>Automatic-Machine Rifles.</b> In the defensive
the A.M.R’s are usually employed to
obtain flanking fire from the firing line, but
may be used in the cover trench and sometimes
in shallow holes out in front. In interior
fighting they are used to cover stretches of
communicating trenches against an enemy
that has penetrated the first line.</p>

<p class='c008'><b>Riflemen.</b> The riflemen are placed in the
intervals between the specialists in the firing
line. They are also used as snipers and as
sentinels. These sentinels are not to be confused
with watchers, who may or may not
carry rifles.</p>

<h4 class='c016'>In the Offensive</h4>

<p class='c014'><b>Hand Grenades.</b> In the offensive, hand
grenades are used to reach the enemy under
cover in trenches, etc., by high-angle throwing.
It is an excellent weapon to clear out the
trenches that the assaulting columns are
advancing against. The H. G. and the R. G.
break the resistance, so to speak, of the line
that the attack is to capture and the assaulting
troops are to occupy and hold. The
<span class='pageno' id='Page_8'>8</span>places of the hand grenadiers in the assaulting
column are seen in the diagram.</p>

<p class='c008'>The hand grenade is the principal weapon
in trench combat—that is, to obtain progress
laterally and in depth in the trenches after a
breach has been made at one point, as every
foot of trench has to be fought for. Each
section of trench, between traverses, is cleared
of the enemy by throwing H. G’s into it. It
is then occupied and the next section cleared
and occupied in a similar manner.</p>

<p class='c008'>In a raid on the enemy’s trenches hand
grenades are used to clear up the particular
stretch of trenches before the raiding party
jumps into them. This will be taken up in
detail later.</p>

<p class='c008'><b>Rifle Grenades.</b> The rifle grenade in the
offensive is employed similarly to the hand
grenade, to reach an enemy under cover, but
at a greater distance.</p>

<p class='c008'>It is used to help reduce all nests of resistance
that the assaulting infantry runs up
against, and when the artillery barrage is not
obtainable for that purpose.</p>

<p class='c008'>They may be used as a barrage to cut off
the retreat of a small group of the enemy that
is being attacked in front.</p>

<p class='c008'>Rifle grenades are very useful against counterattacks,
especially before machine guns
<span class='pageno' id='Page_9'>9</span>can be brought up and the defensive artillery
barrage obtained.</p>

<p class='c008'><b>The A. M. R.</b> The A. M. R., with its
great mobility and ease of control, makes it
possible to carry this weapon in the assault
and to be used immediately the wave is halted
for any reason. In this connection, it can be
instantly employed against a nest of resistance.</p>

<p class='c008'>It is used in the assault to protect the flanks
of the assaulting waves, especially when
stopped.</p>

<p class='c008'>As the A. M. R’s are brought up in the first
wave, they are immediately available against
counterattacks upon the captured position.
In a similar manner they are employed to
hold ground gained until an artillery barrage
can be obtained to support it and before the
machine guns come up.</p>

<p class='c008'><b>The Riflemen.</b> The riflemen, with bayonets
fixed, do the necessary fighting in the interior
of the enemy’s position. As was stated
before, the H. G. and the R. G. break the
enemy’s resistance and the rifleman does
the hand-to-hand fighting required to occupy
the objective lines of trenches.</p>

<p class='c008'>To make a little résumé, we may say that
the best results will be obtained by the proper
combination of all of these weapons. The
low trajectory weapons (rifle, A. M. R., H. G.,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_10'>10</span>and the 37 mm. gun) concentrate on everything
that shows itself above the trenches;
while the high-angle missiles (H. G. and R. G.)
seek out the enemy under cover. The riflemen
complete the success of the specialists by
rushing forward and occupying the enemy’s
position and fighting hand to hand for it if
necessary.</p>

<h3 class='c013'>III.  Formations for Maneuvering this Resultant Company of Specialists</h3>

<div class="section"></div>
<h3 class='c013'>(Formation of the Platoon)</h3>

<p class='c014'><b>Initial Formation.</b> The initial formation
of the platoon in sections of specialists as per
diagram is almost self-explanatory. Each
group of specialists is in this formation
under the control of its leader ready for any
maneuver.</p>

<p class='c008'>The platoon is the attacking unit because it
contains all the specialists required for the
assault. The frontage of an offensive is composed
of a series of platoons, each with a
definite objective, and each with reinforcing
platoons in depth following.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id001'>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_11'>11</span>
<img src='images/i_b_011.jpg' alt='INITIAL FORMATION OF THE PLATOON LINE OF SECTION COLUMNS' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_12'>12</span>All other formations, whether for combat
or ordinary march maneuvers, are based upon
this initial formation.</p>

<p class='c008'><b>Close Order and March Formations.</b> From
the initial formation, we pass to the close
order formations, used for parade, roll call,
or the march.</p>

<p class='c008'>(<i>a</i>)  First we have the company in line, which
is the habitual formation for assembly.</p>

<p class='c008'>(<i>b</i>)  From the company in line is formed a
column of fours, for marching. The squads
that are complete execute “squads right or
left,” while the remaining odd number of
specialists in any section execute the easiest
movement to bring them into column of fours,
sometimes with blank files behind the rest of
their section.</p>

<p class='c008'><b>Approach March.</b> The approach march is
a name given to the formations that the platoon
in section columns takes up to minimize
casualties while crossing the zone of artillery
fire.</p>

<p class='c008'>These formations are taken up under the
conditions of open warfare, or, in the case of
reinforcements, following up an attack.</p>

<p class='c008'>The formations may be in “Line of Section
Columns” or “Double Line of Section Columns.”
In the first case, each section may be
in single file or in double column; or again the
first and fourth platoon section may be in
double column and the second and third sections
in single file: In the “Double Line of
Section Columns” any of the formations in
the diagrams may be taken up, depending
upon circumstances.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id001'>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_13'>13</span>
<img src='images/i_b_013.jpg' alt='FORMATIONS FOR ASSEMBLY, MARCH, AND PARADE' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_14'>14</span>The interval between sections is variable,
but usually the interval is such as to give
room for the proper development into line of
skirmishers.</p>

<p class='c008'><b>Skirmishers.</b> This formation of skirmishers
is not taken up for the assault, but under
similar conditions as that of the approach
march—that is, for open warfare and for the
advance of the reinforcing platoons behind an
attack.</p>

<p class='c008'>To form the skirmish line, each section
column simply deploys into line, each man
going either right or left front into line from
the regular formation of double line of section
column.</p>

<p class='c008'>If you inspect the figure, you will see
that this deployment into skirmish line gives
practically the type formation of the first
reinforcing platoon in the assaulting column.</p>

<p class='c008'><b>Assaulting Formations.</b> In the attack the
platoon forms and goes forward in waves.
A wave is not one line of men, but is composed
usually of two or three lines.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id001'>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_15'>15</span>
<img src='images/i_b_015.jpg' alt='PLATOON IN DOUBLE LINE OF SECTION COLUMNS COMPANY FORMATIONS FOR MANOEUVRE' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_16'>16</span>The composition of the lines of the wave
depends upon the duties and functions of the
different specialists during the attack.</p>

<p class='c008'>Let us recapitulate the functions of the
specialists in order to show the reasons for
their positions in the assaulting wave.</p>

<p class='c008'><b>The First Line of the Assaulting Wave.</b>
In this line are the grenadiers, whose duty it
is to clear the enemy out of the objective
trenches. Here also are the A. M. R’s,
employed to protect the flanks of the wave.
When the wave is halted, the A. M. R’s must
be available for instant use against any nest
of resistance and must therefore be in the
first line. They are also used in the captured
trench to withstand an enemy’s counterattack,
which may develop within five minutes after
its capture.</p>

<p class='c008'><b>The Second Line of the First Wave.</b> We
have here the rifle grenadiers who help the
hand grenadiers break up the enemy’s resistance
and clear the trenches of the enemy.
This is done by fire of rifle grenades from the
second line. Here, also, we have all the riflemen
of the platoon, whose function it is to
follow up the success of the specialists and
drive the surviving hostile men out of the
trenches with the bayonet.</p>

</div>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_18'>18</span><b>Third Line of the First Wave.</b> In this line
we have the “trench cleaners” or “moppers-up.”
These are hand grenadiers furnished
by the reinforcing platoon and their function
is to clear the enemy out of the trenches, both
laterally and in depth of the position. The
assaulting column remains above ground and
continues across the position to the objective
line of trenches, which is usually the limiting
objective of the attack. The “trench
cleaners” picket all entrances and exits of
dugouts to allow none of the enemy to come
out after the waves have passed and fire into
the backs of the assaulting troops.</p>

<p class='c008'>These three lines compose the first wave,
and we see that the specialists are placed in
the lines in the order of their duties.</p>

<h4 class='c016'>Company Drill Regulations Adopted at Fort Sheridan, Illinois, R.O.T.C., in Lieu of No Existing Official Regulations</h4>

<h5 class='c016'>Company Organization</h5>

<p class='c014'>1.  For the purposes of drill and maneuver,
the regiment will be organized as follows:</p>

<p class='c008'>(<i>a</i>) One training company, as at present
constituted, will form two platoons.</p>

<p class='c008'>(<i>b</i>) The new organization contemplates
four platoons to the company. When, for
training purposes, a complete company is
necessary or desirable, companies will be
combined.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id001'>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_19'>19</span>
<img src='images/i_b_019.jpg' alt='PLATOON PASSING FROM MANEUVER TO COMBAT FORMATION' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_20'>20</span>2.  For a training company of two platoons,
the 2nd in command (sergeant) of the first
platoon is the right guide; the 2nd in command
of the 2nd platoon is the left guide.</p>

<p class='c008'>3.  The platoons, in line or column, are
arranged as at present.</p>

<p class='c008'>4.  The usual arrangement of a company
for attack is to place two platoons in the 1st
wave and two in the 2nd wave. The two platoons
in the 1st wave are known as the assaulting
platoons; the two in the 2nd wave, as
the reinforcing platoons. The normal distance
between the assaulting and reinforcing
platoon is about 65 yards. Sometimes three
platoons are placed in the 1st wave and one
in the 2nd wave.</p>

<p class='c008'>5.  The first wave is followed, at a distance
of 15 yards, by the hand grenadiers of the
reinforcing platoon, who are sent forward
by the commander of the reinforcing platoon
to act as trench cleaners or moppers-up for the
first wave. Fifty yards behind these is the
remainder of the reinforcing platoon. There
are no “moppers-up” for the reinforcing
platoon.</p>

<p class='c008'>6. The captain of a company has four
liaison agents constantly with him, one being
<span class='pageno' id='Page_21'>21</span>furnished from and for each platoon. They
march immediately in rear of the captain.</p>

<p class='c008'>7. The post of the captain is between the
1st and 2nd waves.</p>

<h5 class='c016'>Platoon Organization</h5>

<p class='c014'>1. The composition of a platoon is as
follows:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>1 Lieutenant (1st and 4th platoons under 1st Lieutenants).</div>
      <div class='line in13'>(2nd and 3rd platoons under 2nd Lieutenants).</div>
      <div class='line'>1 Sergeant (2nd in command, assistant to platoon leader).</div>
      <div class='line'><b>First Section</b>—(Grenadiers).</div>
      <div class='line in4'>1  Sergeant—Section Sergeant.</div>
      <div class='line in4'>2 Corporals and 12 Privates—Hand Grenadiers.</div>
      <div class='line in4'>1 Corporal and 6 Privates—Rifle Grenadiers.</div>
      <div class='line'><b>Second Section</b>—(Riflemen).</div>
      <div class='line in4'>2 Corporals and 10 Privates—Riflemen.</div>
      <div class='line'><b>Third Section</b>—(Riflemen).</div>
      <div class='line in4'>2 Corporals and 10 Privates—Riflemen.</div>
      <div class='line'><b>Fourth Section</b>—(Automatic Rifle).</div>
      <div class='line in4'>1 Sergeant—Charge of 1 gun crew.</div>
      <div class='line in4'>1 Corporal—Charge of 1 gun crew.</div>
      <div class='line'>3 Privates, 1st Class—Gunners—1 in charge of each gun and 1 in reserve.</div>
      <div class='line'>6 Privates—Ammunition Carriers.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_22'>22</span>2.  All platoons are alike in numbers, organization,
and armament.</p>

<p class='c008'>3.  When the platoon is in column of squads
or in line, the post of the platoon leader is as
at present. When in line of section columns
he is normally in front of the right center
section, although he may be in front of some
other section if he sees fit. In attack formation
he is in the center of his platoon between
his first and second lines.</p>

<p class='c008'>4.  When the platoon is in line, the post of
the 2nd in command is in rear of the center of
his platoon. In line of section columns he is
in front of the 3rd section. In attack formation
he is in rear of the fight center of the
second line.</p>

<h5 class='c016'>Platoon Movements</h5>

<h6 class='c016'>1.</h6>

<p class='c014'>1.  The 1st Section (Grenadier Section)
contains 15 rifle grenadiers (including the
section sergeant) and 7 hand grenadiers.
When in column of squads, the rifle grenadiers
march as a squad, in rear of the hand grenadiers.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_23'>23</span>The 1st Section constitutes 3 squads,
each having the No. 3 in the rear rank as a
blank file. The Section Sergeant marches
abreast of the rear rank of the 2nd squad of
his section. Line is formed by executing
squads right or left.</p>

<p class='c008'>2.  The 2nd Section (Riflemen Section)
contains 10 privates and 2 corporals. One
corporal has charge of 7 men, the other of 3
men. When in column of squads, the section
forms one complete squad and the front rank
of another. Corporals are number four.
To form line at the command “Squads left
(right),” the complete squad executes “Squad
left”; of the half squad the Nos. 3 and 4
execute “Twos left”; the Nos. 1 and 2 likewise
execute “Twos left,” thus placing themselves
in rear of Nos. 3 and 4. To form
column from line at the command “Squads
right,” the Nos. 3 and 4 of the incomplete
squad move forward two paces, execute “Twos
right,” and place themselves in rear of Nos.
3 and 4 of the preceding squad; Nos. 1 and 2
move forward two paces, execute “Twos
right,” and place themselves in rear of Nos.
1 and 2 of the preceding squad.</p>

<p class='c008'>3.  The personnel, numbers and movements
of the 3rd Section are identical with
those of the 2nd.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_24'>24</span>4.  The 4th Section (Automatic Rifle Section)
contains 1 sergeant, 1 corporal, and 9
privates (total of 11). One complete squad
is formed and 2 privates are left over who
march in rear of Nos. 1 and 4 of the squad.
The corporal is No. 4 of the front rank. No.
3, front and rear rank, are the gunners. The
sergeant marches abreast of the rear rank of
the squad in the line of file-closers; when
line is formed, the two men left over form one
additional file on the left (right) of their sections.
In forming for attack formation, the
No. 4 of the two men left over attaches himself
to the front rank gun crew and goes with
them; the No. 1, to the rear rank gun crew.
The sergeant remains with his gun crew if the
guns are separated, or assumes charge of both
when together.</p>

<p class='c008'>5.  If the training company contains more
men than are necessary to fill the platoons as
indicated above, such additional men will be
carried as riflemen and attached to the second
and third sections of the platoons.</p>

<h6 class='c016'>II</h6>

<p class='c014'>1.  To form line of section columns from
line.</p>

<p class='c008'>The left file of each section moves straight
to the front, followed by the file next on its
<span class='pageno' id='Page_25'>25</span>right, and this in turn by the other files of the
section. The section sergeants of the 1st
and 4th sections place themselves at the head
of their respective sections.</p>

<p class='c008'>2.  To form line of section columns in
columns of twos or fours.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Half-squads (squads) right front into
line.”</p>

<p class='c008'>3.  To form line from line of section
columns.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Sections, right front into line.”</p>

<p class='c008'>4.  To form column of squads from line of
section columns.</p>

<p class='c008'>First form line of section columns in column
of squads—then “Column of squads—1st
(4th) section forward (column right or
left).”</p>

<p class='c008'>5.  To form line of section columns from
column of squads.</p>

<p class='c008'>The left file of the leading section moves
straight to the front, followed by the remaining
files of the squad, then by the left file of the
second squad, etc. The 2nd, 3rd, and 4th sections
oblique to the right (left) in column of
squads to section interval and, when in rear
of their place, form column of files. The
section may thus be marched in echelon, or
line may be formed by halting the leading section,
or the sections in rear may be double-timed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_26'>26</span>to the line established by the leading
section.</p>

<p class='c008'>6.  To form line of section columns to the
flank, command:</p>

<p class='c008'>“Sections, column left (right).”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Line of section columns.”</p>

<p class='c008'>7.  Frequently, for convenience in maneuvering,
the platoon leader may, when in
line of section columns, wish to form only two
columns from his four columns. In such
event he will command:</p>

<p class='c008'>“Double sections, 1st and 4th sections forward.”</p>

<p class='c008'>One rifle section will follow the first section.
The other rifle section, the 4th section. The
rifle sections in such formation are always in
rear of the specialist sections.</p>

<p class='c008'>8.  Intervals between sections or double
sections are opened and closed by the command:</p>

<p class='c008'>“To —— spaces extend (close).”</p>

<h6 class='c016'>III</h6>

<p class='c014'>1.  Attack formation is taken up from line
of section columns <i>only</i>.</p>

<p class='c008'>2.  The attack formation is always in two
lines. The two lines constitute a wave.</p>

<p class='c008'>3.  Hand grenadiers and automatic riflemen
<span class='pageno' id='Page_27'>27</span>are always in the first line. The riflemen
and rifle grenadiers are always in the
second line in the assaulting platoon. Rifle
grenadiers may be posted in the center of the
second line, or on either flank, as the platoon
leader directs. Similarly the automatic riflemen
may be in the center, on either flank, or
divided between center and flank of the first
line, as the platoon leader may direct.</p>

<p class='c008'>4.  The 1st and 2nd lines are separated by
a distance of 20 paces.</p>

<p class='c008'>5.  To pass from line of section columns to
attack formation, the platoon leader commands:</p>

<p class='c008'>“Form for attack at (<i>place</i>). Automatic
rifles to center (left flank) (right flank) (both
flanks) (left and center). Rifle grenadiers to
center (left) (right).”</p>

<p class='c008'>Only the automatic riflemen and grenadiers
need be designated. The remaining men accommodate
themselves to their movements.</p>

<p class='c008'>At the above command the 2nd and 3rd
sections stand fast until the 1st and 4th sections
have cleared their front. They then
move to their places led by the corporal at
the head of their respective sections.</p>

<p class='c008'>This movement will be executed at first in
quick time; as men become more proficient,
in double time and at a run.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_28'>28</span>
  <h6 class='c016'>IV</h6>
</div>

<p class='c014'>1.  The arrangement of specialists in the
reinforcing platoon differs somewhat from the
assaulting platoon. The hand grenadiers of
the reinforcing platoon are sent forward in
two squads to follow in rear of the 2nd line of
the first wave at a distance of about 15 yards.
The two squads are abreast of each other, the
section sergeant between them.</p>

<p class='c008'>2.  The rifle grenadiers of the reinforcing
platoon are then moved up into the 1st line.</p>

<p class='c008'>3.  The riflemen of the reinforcing platoon
remain in the 2nd line.</p>

<p class='c008'>4.  The position of the platoon leader of the
reinforcing platoon is in front of the center of
the 1st line. The position of the 2nd in command
is the same as in the assaulting platoon.</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER II<br /> DEVELOPMENT OF A POSITION FROM AN OPEN WARFARE BATTLE</h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'><b>General Use of Fortifications.</b> The first
use of fortifications, whether hasty or permanent,
is to give shelter against hostile fire.
The more deliberate use of fortifications is
to increase the holding or fighting power of
troops by the proper employment of the
natural defensive features of the ground and
by artificial devices.</p>

<div class="section"></div>
<h3 class='c013'>Successive Phases of the Organization</h3>

<p class='c014'><b>Change from Battle Lines to Trenches of a
Position.</b> During a battle, as we understand
it in open warfare, as soon as the fighting lines
are halted for any reason, every man immediately
begins to dig in for shelter against the
enemy’s fire. If the halting of these fighting
lines is more or less permanent these “skirmish
holes” are connected, and we have the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_35'>35</span>beginning of a rude trench. We must remember
that in a battle troops are disposed in
depth in a series of lines. All these lines dig
for protection in a similar manner, giving the
beginning of several lines of trenches. If the
troops remain for any time in this position,
it is necessary to have routes from the rear to
the front to carry up ammunition and supplies
to the different lines. These communication
routes are also dug in, and we have the
beginning of communicating trenches. Soon
the men will begin to seek better protection
against rain, cold, and overhead fire, and build
themselves some kind of shelters. In a
similar manner command posts and supply
depots are established.</p>

<p class='c008'>In time there is a complete skeleton of a
series of lines of trenches outlining a position.
If the mission of the troops is to remain and
hold the ground, the necessary plan of organization
for the final position will have to be
based upon this skeleton. The purpose of
this new organization, as we have noted, is to
establish the position so that the ground can
be held by fewer troops.</p>

<p class='c008'><b>Active and Passive Elements of a Position,
Especially Support Points.</b> The first fire
trench of a position is continuous, but it is
not good practice to man the whole of this line,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_36'>36</span>because this would take too many men and
defeat the purpose of the fortifications.
Secondly, a better defense can be established
by garrisoning a series of strong points, or
salients, from which can be obtained flanking
fire. In the first line these are called support
points. The trenches connecting these support
points are retained as such, but are not
usually manned. This curtain trench, so to
speak, is retained for communicating purposes,
and to deceive the enemy as to the real
points of defense. A few watchers are left
in it.</p>

<p class='c008'>The first line, then, is a series of support
points, well defended by men and special
weapons, and at such distances apart as to
support each other.</p>

<p class='c008'><b>Division of Position.</b> The garrison of such
a support point in the first line is a company,
and the captain is responsible for the holding
of this ground. (The platoon, we must remember,
is a tactical unit.) In dividing the
first line into these active elements the size
of each support point depends upon the importance
of the ground or of the tactical
situation.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id002'>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_37'>37</span>
<img src='images/i_b_037.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_38'>38</span>Similar natural strong points are also located
in the second line. They will be fewer
and farther apart in this line than in the first
line, which is exposed to hostile attacks.
These points in the second line are connected
with the support points and together the
group is called a center of resistance. The
command of such a center of resistance, including
one or two support points in the
front line, falls to a battalion commander with
his unit. For example, the area of a center of
resistance under the command of a Bn. C. O.
will include, say, two support points in the
first line with a company in each, and the
strong point in the second line with two companies.</p>

<p class='c008'>In the third line, also, natural strong points
are located and organized for defense. The
command of this strong point, including, let
us say, two centers of resistance, falls to a
colonel with his regiment. Such an area is
called a sector, or a sub-sector. If it is a sub-sector
two such constitute a sector in command
of a brigadier-general.</p>

<p class='c008'><b>Different Lines of a Sector.</b> We have now
arrived automatically at the fact that each
sector is composed of a series of lines in depth,
each defended in strong points.</p>

<p class='c008'>The first line is termed the line of resistance,
as the first defense is made against the enemy’s
attacks in the support points of this line.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id001'>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_39'>39</span>
<img src='images/i_b_039.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_40'>40</span>The second, or main line of resistance, is
called the support line. In the strong points
of the centers of resistance are the reserves
and the headquarters of the battalion commanders.</p>

<p class='c008'>The third line is called the covering line of
the artillery, because it defends the batteries
distributed behind it. It also contains the
reserve troops of the sector, a battalion usually
holding each strong point. Here are established
the headquarters of the colonel and
the different central depots of the sector.</p>

<p class='c008'>The above three lines constitute one position.
There may be several positions in
depth at distances of three miles or more
apart. Usually there are two positions and
sometimes three. It is said that the Germans
have as many as six positions in depth
in places. The first position only, of course,
is permanently occupied.</p>

<h4 class='c016'>Principles of the Organization</h4>

<p class='c014'><b>Advantages of the Continuous Trench.</b>
The continuous or curtain trench between
support points must not be eliminated for
several reasons. The trench will deceive the
enemy as to the location of the elements of
support points. If this trench were absent
the enemy could easily locate these, and subject
them to concentrated artillery fire. The
position cannot be hidden from airplane observation
but the essential elements, such as
emplacements, dugouts, etc., must be concealed.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id001'>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_41'>41</span>
<img src='images/i_b_041.jpg' alt='Traces of Trenches Used to obtain Flanking Fire Types of Communicating Trenches.' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_42'>42</span>The curtain trench serves for communicating
purposes for lateral movements of troops
and for liaison between neighboring units.</p>

<p class='c008'>The absence of the curtain trench would
leave breaches in the line where in a general
attack units could concentrate and break
through. In such a general attack the curtain
trench is occupied and defended by the
reserves. Barbed wire, of course, protects
the entire front.</p>

<p class='c008'>These trenches also serve, if necessary, as
cover for reserves acting as reinforcements
to the adjacent support points, as there is
only sufficient shelter in a support point for
its own permanent garrison.</p>

<p class='c008'>Lastly they may serve as trenches of departure
in the offensive.</p>

<p class='c008'><b>Importance of Flanking Fire.</b> It is possible
to have the support points at intervals
because flanking fire from these will command
all ground in front. The importance of
flanking fire cannot be overestimated. Everything
must be done to obtain it.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id001'>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_43'>43</span>
<img src='images/i_b_043.jpg' alt='Type of a Good Entanglement in front of a Firing Line Without Salients To Obtain Flanking Fire' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_44'>44</span>Sometimes it is impossible to obtain flanking
fire because of lack of salients. If this is true
the trace of the first line trench must be rectified
to give flanking fire along the line as per
diagram.</p>

<p class='c008'>When neither of these two methods is
possible small combat posts with machine
guns are located in advance of the line to
obtain flanking fire.</p>

<p class='c008'>The machine gun is the best weapon for
flanking fire. Several emplacements are constructed
for each machine gun, but during
the bombardment it is kept under cover in
a dugout. When the attack develops the
machine gun is quickly set up in the proper
emplacement. If kept in a permanent emplacement
the enemy will soon locate it and
put it out of business by artillery fire.</p>

<p class='c008'>If no emplacements are possible or if they
are destroyed machine guns are operated on
open ground or in shell holes.</p>

<p class='c008'><b>Field of Fire.</b> With proper flanking fire
a line can be defended with a shorter field of
fire than otherwise. A hundred yards of
field of fire is sufficient with good flanking
fire and accessory defenses, such as barbed
wire, etc.</p>

<img src='images/i_b_045.jpg' alt='DIVISION OF POSITION INTO COMPARTMENTS FOR INTERIOR DEFENSE' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_46'>46</span><b>Location of Trenches.</b> Lines of trenches
which are the result of a battle are not always
located in the most logical positions. They
are the results of the exigencies of the battle.
However, it is well to know the best locations
for the trenches of a position under different
conditions in order to place them there when
possible.</p>

<p class='c008'>In flat country, of course, it makes no difference
where the trenches are located. On the
profile of a hill, however, the question is
where to locate the first and where to locate
the second line. Let us consider Figure 15.
Point A is out of the question as you have no
view of the enemy. At B you can observe
the enemy’s line and he can observe yours.
However, the enemy can shell you at this
point and observe the results. At C the same
conditions obtain as at B, except there is a
dead angle directly in front. At D you cannot
observe the enemy nor can the enemy
observe your line. From these considerations
we see that the proper location for the first
line will be at B as you must be able to observe
the enemy and all the ground in front. Your
second line should be located at D where the
enemy cannot observe and bombard your
position. At D the line can be made as elaborate
as you have time, men, and material,
because you are more or less unmolested by
the enemy’s fire and observation.</p>

<p class='c008'>The reverse slope is of the very greatest
<span class='pageno' id='Page_47'>47</span>importance in organizing a position. Movements
of troops and supplies can be easily
accomplished here under cover. Deep dugouts
can be constructed with the least work.
But the greatest advantage lies during the
bombardment. The enemy is not able to
observe the accuracy of his fire on the reverse
slope so that the elements in this line are left
more or less intact. For this reason the line
on the reverse slope becomes the most important
line of resistance against the enemy’s
attacks. The Germans habitually organize
their reverse slopes very strongly.</p>

<p class='c008'><b>Division of the Position into Defensive
Compartments.</b> We have already spoken
of the sector in depth by successive lines.
In the same way it is necessary to organize
the positions for lateral defense. A support
point may be captured by the enemy and from
this ground he can launch a flanking attack
on the adjacent part of the position. It is
necessary that there should be an established
defense against such an attack, and for this
purpose each sector is divided into compartments,
so to speak, with all-around defense.</p>

<p class='c008'>Boyaux or communicating trenches on the
flanks of these compartments are organized
as firing lines with barbed wire belts running
parallel and with machine guns disposed for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_48'>48</span>flanking fire. We have then each sector cut
up into compartments capable of independent
resistance in all directions, if the surrounding
compartments are captured by the enemy.
Such a compartment also has the advantage
of serving as a base for a counterattack against
an adjoining one that has fallen into the
hands of the enemy.</p>

<p class='c008'>In a sector the responsibility of such lateral
defenses falls especially upon the colonel.</p>

<p class='c008'><b>Concealment.</b> All of the essential elements
of a position, emplacements, dugouts,
etc., are more or less without value if they can
be seen by the enemy and subjected to heavy
artillery fire. Everything that is possible
must be constructed without the observation
of the enemy.</p>

<p class='c008'>It is important to hide your works by making
them fit in with the color scheme and
shape of the surrounding ground. False or
dummy trenches, emplacements, shelters,
etc., are constructed to cause the enemy to
waste his ammunition. The art of camouflage
is also extensively employed for this purpose
against both ground and aërial observation.</p>

<h4 class='c016'>Elements of the Organization</h4>

<p class='c014'><b>Plan of Organization.</b> We have seen that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_49'>49</span>the first outline of the trenches left as a consequence
of the battle must be modified in
detail to obtain better protection and organization.
The complete plan of reorganization
is laid down by the commander of the sector
and is called the Plan of Organization.</p>

<p class='c008'>This plan is drawn up as soon as the position
has a permanent garrison. The Plan
of Organization must be faithfully followed
by all the successive garrisons of the sector.
After its adoption, even the commander of
the sector himself cannot modify the plan
without the consent of the general in charge.</p>

<p class='c008'>The real value of the position depends upon
the amount of continuous work that has been
done in carrying out the original plan.</p>

<p class='c008'><b>Outline of the First Line.</b> As was seen
before, the original trace of the first line was
established as a consequence of the needs of
the battle. In the organization plan, it is
necessary to introduce several modifications
in this trace. The commander responsible for
this change should place himself in the situation
of the enemy and consider an attack upon
his own lines. From this consideration he
will introduce such modifications as will make
this task as difficult as possible.</p>

<p class='c008'>The responsibility of making this modification
in the trace of the first line does not
<span class='pageno' id='Page_50'>50</span>devolve upon the captain in the first line.
As a rule if it were left to him few changes
would be made because of lack of initiative
on his part, or because of fear that if the line
were captured he would be blamed for having
changed it. This task falls upon the battalion
commander who is responsible for the
center of resistance, with the consent of the
sector commander. The reason for this is
that the sector commander is the only one of
these officers who knows the subsequent use of
this particular sector, whether for defensive
or offensive purposes. If for defensive purposes
the line may be carried as close to the
enemy’s line as possible. If the sector is
being organized for an offensive there must
be enough distance between to keep his own
line out of the zone of artillery dispersion
when the target is the enemy’s line.</p>

<p class='c008'><b>Cover Trench.</b> In general all fire trenches
have a second trench behind, called the
doubling or cover trench. The use of the
cover trench is not primarily for defensive
purposes. It has special uses.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id002'>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_51'>51</span>
<img src='images/i_b_051.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_52'>52</span>The majority of the troops in the first line
are kept in the cover trench in shelters located
there. The first line is habitually
manned by only a sufficient number of men
to assure observation and security. The rest
of the garrison remains in the shelters of the
cover trench to get as much rest as possible.
It is very important that comfortable shelters
be located in the doubling trench. If
troops are exposed to the elements and bombardment
their value decreases very rapidly.
If the shelling becomes too severe the men in
the first line retire to the shelters of the cover
trench until the attack develops.</p>

<p class='c008'>Another use of the cover trench in the defensive
is to keep here a necessary number of
troops for reinforcing the first line when necessary
and for counterattack against the same
if it is taken. This latter use establishes the
distance between the two lines, which is from
thirty to forty yards, so that hand grenades
can be thrown from the cover trench into the
first line.</p>

<p class='c008'>Behind each support point there is usually
a lateral communicating ditch called the circulating
ditch which should not be confused
with the cover trench.</p>

<p class='c008'><b>Advance Posts.</b> In front of the firing line
certain advance posts are established. There
are three kinds of these: listening, observation,
and combat posts.</p>

<p class='c008'>The <i>listening post</i> is not under the control
of the commander of the support point but
is in the service of the Intelligence Officer.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_53'>53</span>It is furnished with a microphone for the purpose
of picking up enemy’s telephone messages
in the hostile line.</p>

<p class='c008'>The <i>observation post</i> belongs to the sector
and is used for purposes of observation and
security.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id001'>
<img src='images/i_b_053.jpg' alt='OBSERVATION POST' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c008'>The <i>combat post</i> is established to obtain
flanking fire along the barbed wire entanglements
or it is used as a bombing post when
in close proximity to the enemy’s trenches.</p>

<p class='c008'>Sometimes a series of combat posts are
connected and a new trench established in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_54'>54</span>front of the firing line. This is called the
observation line. It is best to avoid this practice
as there is always the question whether to
hold or abandon this line when the enemy’s
attack develops. In either case there are
grave disadvantages. If it is held you have a
weak line. If you abandon it the enemy can
use it for shelter.</p>

<p class='c008'>Advance posts give excellent service if not
too numerous. If there are many of them
they are a temptation for hostile raids.</p>

<p class='c008'><b>Dimensions of Trenches.</b> These can be
found in text-books on the subject. The
general idea is that they are to be narrow and
deep to prevent observation and to present a
small target for high-angle fire.</p>

<p class='c008'><b>Loopholes.</b> Loopholes are used in the ordinary
life of the trenches for observation and
sniping purposes; but against the real attack
of the enemy the firing is done over the parapet.
If it is necessary to meet the enemy in hand to
hand combat the men climb up on the parapet.</p>

<p class='c008'><b>Traverses.</b> Traverses are used to localize
the effect of shell or grenade explosions, and
to prevent enfilade fire.</p>

<p class='c008'>They are sometimes used in long stretches
of boyaux or communicating ditches as emplacements
for A. M. R. to enfilade the same
if the enemy penetrates the position.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_55'>55</span><b>Transversal Lines.</b> Transversal lines are
usually constructed between the first and
the second lines and between the second and
the third lines. They are short stretches of
trenches parallel to the front for special purposes:
such as disposing of machine guns and
trench mortars in depth; bombing posts for
rifle and hand grenadiers; depots and observation
posts.</p>

<p class='c008'>Command posts are usually located in such
small transversal trenches, a little in rear of
the lines they are in command of. For instance,
the captain in charge of a support
point might be located in a transversal just
in rear of the cover trench.</p>

<p class='c008'><b>Support Trenches.</b> The second or support
line is established at such a distance that the
first line is covered by its fire if the latter is
captured.</p>

<p class='c008'>Also the second line should be placed so
that it will be out of the zone of dispersion
if the first line is the artillery target either of
your own or of hostile fire. This places the
distance between the two lines at from 150
to 400 yards. At this distance also rifle
grenade fire can be used in conjunction with
an artillery preparation for a counterattack
against the first line.</p>

<p class='c008'>The organization of the second line is the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_56'>56</span>same as that of the first; in other words, the
same principles and elements of defense are
used: making employment of barbed wire,
flanking fire, cover trenches, etc.</p>

<p class='c008'>The second line is the main line of resistance
and must be made as nearly impregnable as
possible. For this purpose it must be thoroughly
and completely organized.</p>

<p class='c008'>In the support line are the reserves of the
C. of R. and for their proper shelter they
should have very deep dugouts, and all the
requisites for the comfort and rest of the
troops.</p>

<p class='c008'><b>Redoubts.</b> Behind the support line is a
redoubt containing the command post of the
battalion commander. It is the last strong
point of the center of resistance and is organized
for an all-around defense.</p>

<p class='c008'>The line of redoubts is the last line of serious
resistance. If the enemy penetrates this line
a breach has been made in the position at this
point.</p>

<p class='c008'><b>Boyaux and Communicating Ditches.</b> As
we have said before trenches for communicating
purposes must be dug both in depth and
laterally. We shall call those from front to
rear boyaux, and those running laterally communicating
ditches.</p>

<p class='c008'>The number of boyaux is not fixed as that of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_57'>57</span>the different lines. There must be at least
one between each support point and its center
of resistance.</p>

<p class='c008'>Usually boyaux are used for movements in
both directions. Often certain boyaux are
designated for entrance only and others for
evacuation. The numbers of the latter are
usually less than the former.</p>

<p class='c008'>In an attack all boyaux are used for movements
from rear to front.</p>

<p class='c008'>All movements to the rear while reinforcements
are being brought up must be executed
in the open ground, exceptions being made in
the case of wounded.</p>

<p class='c008'>Boyaux are important for the movement of
supplies and ammunition, but above all they
are essential for reinforcements during battle.
The greater part of the troops in a sector is
held in reserve in the second and third lines.
This disposition is only possible if you have
good boyaux to the front lines.</p>

<p class='c008'>All boyaux and communicating ditches are
narrow and deep. Boyaux are wider between
the second and third line than they are between
the first and second. Evacuation
boyaux are usually wider than others. The
trace of a boyau must be such as to prevent
enfilade fire.</p>

<p class='c008'>At intervals of about ten yards turnouts large
<span class='pageno' id='Page_58'>58</span>enough for a stretcher are constructed in the
side of the boyaux for passage of troops in
different directions. Boyaux are named and
signs are put up similar to those for streets in
a city. The same name of a boyau must be
kept from the third lines to the first.</p>

<p class='c008'>At branches of the main boyaux they are
dug a little deeper to avoid mistakes of identification.</p>

<p class='c008'>As was said before certain boyaux are organized
for defense.</p>

<p class='c008'>It may be said here that supplies carried up
at night are usually brought along on top of
the ground close to the boyaux. This gives
freer movement and the carriers are close to
the cover of the trench if needed.</p>

<p class='c008'><b>Accessory Defense.</b> Of all the accessory
defenses such as barricades, abatis, trous-de-loup,
etc., the most important by far is barbed
wire, which is almost exclusively used for obstacles.</p>

<p class='c008'>Barbed wire should be placed from twenty
to fifty yards in front of the first line. At
this distance shelling of the barbed wire belts
will do very little damage to the first line.</p>

<p class='c008'>The wire entanglements must be under fire
of the first line.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id002'>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_59'>59</span>
<img src='images/i_b_059.jpg' alt='Command Post for Center of Resistance' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_60'>60</span>The trace of the wire belt is not necessarily
parallel to that of the firing line, but should be
so placed as to obtain flanking fire along the
wire belts. Good entanglements are constructed
in double belts, the distance between
the two belts being from ten to twenty yards,
the farthest belt, of course, being constructed
first.</p>

<p class='c008'>Breaches must be left through the wire entanglements
for the passage of patrols, friendly
raiding parties, etc. Portable sections of
barbed wire are used to close these passages
when necessary.</p>

<p class='c008'>All accessory defenses must be concealed
so they cannot be easily observed and destroyed
by the enemy.</p>

<p class='c008'><b>Command Post.</b> A command post, in the
full sense of the word, contains the headquarters
of the leader of a division of a
sector.</p>

<p class='c008'>The command post must first of all be a
good observation post, after which the other
requisites are installed. When the observation
post has been constructed the following
are built: a room for the headquarters staff
to work and to sleep in, a telephone central,
dugout for liaison group, and a depot.</p>

<hr class='c022' />

<p class='c008'>The preceding discussion is a development
of a position from battle conditions. On the
other hand if you are unmolested by the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_61'>61</span>enemy the order of organizing a position
would be as follows:</p>

<p class='c008'>(1)  Construct the emplacement to obtain
flanking fire.</p>

<p class='c008'>(2)  Construct barbed wire entanglements.</p>

<p class='c008'>(3)  Observatory and dugouts.</p>

<p class='c008'>(4)  Trenches.</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER III<br /> SECTOR AND TRENCH DUTIES</h2>
</div>

<div class="section"></div>
<h3 class='c013'>I. Plan of Defense</h3>

<p class='c014'><b>Definition.</b> The Plan of Defense contains
all the different duties necessary to make a
proper defense of the position. The execution
of these duties is the execution of the
Plan of Defense, which follows logically and
depends directly upon the Plan of Organization.</p>

<p class='c008'><b>Principles of the Plan of Defense.</b> (<i>a</i>) The
most important principle of organization
of a position is the <b>disposition of troops in
depth</b>. It is necessary to have plenty of support
and reserve units disposed one behind the
other. Only one-sixth to one-third of a
garrison in the support point of the first line
remains in the trenches for the purpose of observation
and security. The rest remain in
the rear as a reserve for reinforcements or
counterattacks.</p>

<p class='c008'>(<i>b</i>) Each trench, each nest of resistance,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_63'>63</span>each area of the ground, must have a responsible
leader. <b>The garrison of any such area
must never leave the ground allotted to its
defense under any conditions of battle.</b>
The defense must be carried out by this garrison
on the lines originally laid out. A leader
is not allowed to fall back on troops in his
rear or to take up a better position. The
troops in depth are placed there for the
purpose of reinforcements for the lines in
front.</p>

<p class='c008'>(<i>c</i>) <b>Each part of a position that is lost to the
enemy must be immediately retaken by a
counterattack</b> carried out by troops held in
reserve. The first line is retaken by reserve
troops in the support line, and similarly, if
the support line is lost, it must be retaken by
reserve troops held in the third line. If all
three lines are captured, an attempt must be
made to retake the third line by the reserve
troops of the sector.</p>

<p class='c008'><b>Form of Plan of Defense.</b> In each division
of the position from front to rear there must
be a Plan of Defense. This plan always contains
the five following elements:</p>

<h4 class='c016'>Details of Trench Duty</h4>

<p class='c014'><b>Guard Duties (Security).</b> Security is obtained
by the use of sentinels and patrols.</p>

<p class='c008'><b>Sentinels</b> must not be confused with observers,
watchers, or snipers. Observers belong
to the information service of the sector
and are not on duty at night. Snipers operate
only in the daytime. The watchers of the
different lines give the alarm in case of an
attack, and are on duty both day and night.
Sentinels are posted in the first line or in
advanced posts. Their work and number will
<span class='pageno' id='Page_65'>65</span>depend upon the proximity of the enemy, the
tactical situation, and above all upon the
conditions of the wire entanglements out in
front.</p>

<p class='c008'>At night, one sentinel is posted, say, for
example, every 10 yards in the fire trench of
the first line. During the day, only enough
sentinels are posted so that all parts of “No
Man’s Land” can be observed. This will allow
a maximum number of men to rest.</p>

<p class='c008'>In the firing line, the sentinels work in three
reliefs. When not on guard duty, they sleep.
The remainder of the garrison in the cover
trench, however, are available for work, for
patrols, and to furnish supply parties. Sentinels
should have their rifles resting on the
parapet close at hand, ready to fire at a
moment’s notice.</p>

<p class='c008'>By day, the sentinels use a periscope or
observe through a loophole. This practice
is, however, strictly prohibited at night, when
a, sentinel must observe over the parapet.
As little challenging as possible is done, and
then only in a very low tone.</p>

<p class='c008'><b>Reconnoitering Patrols</b> are the best means
for security against attack. Every night
the commanders of the support points or the
centers of resistance send out patrols in front
of the firing line. The strength of a patrol
<span class='pageno' id='Page_66'>66</span>must be sufficient to carry back a wounded
man, <i>i. e.</i>, the number should be five, six, or
more. The success of a patrol depends entirely
upon the leader. He must be clever,
daring, and observant, and the rest of the
patrol is simply his bodyguard. He himself
must observe the objective of the mission of
the patrol.</p>

<p class='c008'>Patrols should never be sent out without
definite orders as to their mission. Such may
be, for example, a reconnaissance of the enemy’s
lines, to discover if the enemy has cut
passages in his wire belt preparatory to an
attack, to examine their own wire entanglements,
etc.</p>

<p class='c008'>The route of the patrol must be exactly
determined; also the hour of departure and
return designated. Word is passed along the
line of sentinels that a patrol is out in front
with the necessary information about the
same. The preparation for a night patrol
must be made during daylight.</p>

<p class='c008'><b>Officer of the Watch.</b> In the firing line
the company commander arranges a roster of
his officers for duty as officer of the watch.
Also in each platoon the platoon commander
will detail a N. C. O. of the watch. The
officer of the watch is responsible for the duties
of observation and security, and is especially
<span class='pageno' id='Page_67'>67</span>responsible for the giving of the alarm in case
of an attack and consequently for the calling
of the artillery barrage by use of rockets,
signals, etc.</p>

<p class='c008'><b>Standing to Arms.</b> It is of the greatest
importance that the troops in the first line
are thoroughly trained in taking their positions
when the alarm is given as quickly as
possible, without confusion. The alarm is
often given for practice in order to ascertain
the amount of time it will take the men to
reach their places in the firing line.</p>

<p class='c008'>The command “Stand to” is usually given
one hour before daylight and one hour before
dark. At this time the company commanders
arrange for inspection of arms, ammunition,
and equipment by the platoon commanders.</p>

<p class='c008'><b>Observers’ Duties.</b> Every effort should be
made to obtain information of the enemy, his
trenches, and his wire entanglements. Any
alteration in the enemy’s lines must immediately
be reported. The importance of forwarding
such information must be impressed
upon all ranks. This duty is carried out by
observers.</p>

<p class='c008'>All men of the company are used as sentinels
in the first line or as watchers in other
lines, but not all are observers. Men who are
to act as observers receive special training.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_68'>68</span>A man to become an observer must have a
special capacity for this task.</p>

<p class='c008'>Each platoon should have at least six such
observers, enough for proper reliefs.</p>

<p class='c008'>The observers are placed:</p>

<p class='c008'>1. In each company the observers are distributed
in a number of observation posts properly
camouflaged so as not to be discovered
by the enemy. These posts may be in advance
of the firing line, in the firing line, or at any
point within the position that has a wide view
of the front. The observers employ periscopes
or field glasses. Everything of note that is
observed is recorded and from these data the
captain makes out his daily observation
report.</p>

<p class='c008'>2. Also in the sector there are 2 or 3 observatories
from which the information is
turned in directly to the colonel. These
posts must be properly concealed and protected.
In each one of these we find the
following:</p>

<p class='c008'>(<i>a</i>) Regulations posted that give the personnel,
tour of duty, sector of observation,
direction to special points of interest, and
certain precautionary measures.</p>

<p class='c008'>(<i>b</i>) Specially prepared blank forms upon
which to record information gained by observation.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_69'>69</span>(<i>c</i>) Field glasses, maps and sketches, and
panoramic views of the ground in front, both
visible and invisible from the observation
posts.</p>

<p class='c008'>(<i>d</i>) A telephone connecting the post with
the nearest command post (center of resistance
or sector).</p>

<p class='c008'>The observers in these posts are directly
under command of the intelligence officers
of the regiment and are of a special personnel.
They must be thoroughly familiar with the
regulations of the posts, maps, panorama, etc.</p>

<p class='c008'>The intelligence officer collects and coordinates
all information gathered in the
sector. Every morning he turns in a consolidated
report made up from the information
in the captains’ daily reports and from the
records of the sector observatories. (In
order to avoid confusion of the different daily
reports these information records are kept on
two different colored blanks, red and blue
alternating each day.)</p>

<p class='c008'>The report of the intelligence officer is
signed by the colonel and sent on to the brigade
headquarters. From the data of his
complete report the intelligence officer very
often must verify certain information by the
use of patrols. For this purpose he makes a
request upon the colonel for special patrols.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_70'>70</span>Information is gathered from both airplanes
and ground observatories. From ground
observatories it is attempted to obtain the
following data;</p>

<p class='c008'>1. To ascertain the intentions of the
enemy.</p>

<p class='c008'>2. To properly prosecute attrition of the
enemy’s works.</p>

<p class='c008'><b>Attrition.</b> By the word attrition in fighting
is meant the gradual destruction of the enemy’s
morale and strength, and demolition,
little by little, of the enemy’s position.
Trench warfare is not a rest or simply a time
for guard duty. It is a phase of the battle in
which you must do as much damage to the
enemy as possible.</p>

<p class='c008'>This work will also keep up the offensive
spirit. For this purpose different means are
used:</p>

<p class='c008'>(<i>a</i>) Sniping: Each company in the first
line uses its best shots as snipers. A sniper
must be a good observer and he must depend
upon his keen eye for evidences of the enemy,
such as smoke of cigarette or the glint of a
bayonet, giving proof of the presence of an
enemy. Especially during hostile shelling
will a too curious enemy come to his loopholes
to observe the effect of the same. This is the
sniper’s chance.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_71'>71</span>In each center of resistance the snipers are
placed under the command of a sniping officer.
He makes the rounds of the snipers’ posts
once or twice a day, and submits a daily report
containing known casualties of the enemy,
location of the number of snipers’ posts,
telescope rifles, fixed rifles, and rifle batteries.</p>

<p class='c008'>(<i>b</i>) Infantry Weapons: Besides sniping,
all the other infantry weapons are used to
assist attrition of the enemy. Hand and
rifle grenades are thrown on special points of
the hostile line. A battery of hand or rifle
grenadiers properly disposed can very often
carry out a concentrated surprise fire on an
enemy’s salient or advanced post. Automatic
and machine guns are always used for
this purpose and especially at night. They
are trained on supply routes, road junctions,
etc., and by use of sudden bursts of fire at
irregular intervals they will compel the
enemy’s supply parties to continue their
transportation in the boyaux instead of on
the open ground.</p>

<p class='c008'>The use of indirect machine gun fire is very
depressing to the enemy. Such judicious
employment of machine guns is sometimes
more effective than severe artillery shelling.</p>

<p class='c008'>The 37 mm. gun, which is also an infantry
weapon, is used principally against hostile
<span class='pageno' id='Page_72'>72</span>machine gun emplacements. The location of
this gun must be constantly changed.</p>

<p class='c008'>(<i>c</i>) Use of Artillery Weapons: Besides
furnishing barrage fire against hostile attacks,
the artillery can be called upon for surprise
fire on working parties, harassing fire during
the night against supply parties and their
routes, and also for reply fire against hostile
shelling.</p>

<p class='c008'>Trench mortars and other engines keep the
enemy as uncomfortable as possible at all
times.</p>

<p class='c008'>(<i>d</i>) Fighting Patrols and Raids: Fighting
patrols and raids are used with the express
purpose of causing loss and damage to the
enemy. This is accomplished by engaging
the enemy’s patrol and working parties or by
raiding his saps, listening posts, or trenches.
Such operations must not, however, degenerate
into frivolous local fighting, causing loss of
men and waste of artillery ammunition.</p>

<p class='c008'><b>Work.</b> Daily trench work consists of (1)
maintenance and (2) new construction.</p>

<p class='c008'>(<i>a</i>) Maintenance: The daily work of
maintaining the elements of the position is
considerable, and its importance often escapes
those responsible for the same. They are:</p>

<p class='c008'>Repair of parapets, boyaux, and shelters
damaged by bombardment, water, or frost.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_73'>73</span>Replacing or completing accessory defenses,
revetments, ammunition recesses, emplacement
of machine guns, observation posts,
depots, etc.</p>

<p class='c008'>Cleaning and Draining of Trenches and
Boyaux: The garrison of each area is responsible
for their own maintenance work,
which is done usually during daylight hours.
Sometimes during severe bombardments this
repair and maintenance work becomes too
great for the garrison and workmen have to
be called in to help.</p>

<p class='c008'>(<i>b</i>) New Construction: New elements of
the position are constructed in carrying out
the Plan of Organization. These are usually
carried out at night. This work is carried
out by troops in the doubling trench, the support
line, or detachments of workmen from
the reserve of the sector. There may also
be special parties from the headquarters detachment
of pioneers or of the engineer battalion
of the brigade.</p>

<p class='c008'>For all these special works the personnel
for whom they are built must be present
during the construction to furnish necessary
information and for inspection. A machine
gun crew helps in building its emplacement;
the intelligence officer directs the construction
of his observatories. The medical officer
<span class='pageno' id='Page_74'>74</span>present during the work on the medical aid
station; the telephone officer superintends the
establishment of his telephone exchange, etc.</p>

<p class='c008'>The battalion commander is responsible for
all the work done in his center of resistance,
and in conjunction with the sector leader
draws up a time-table for the work.</p>

<p class='c008'>All this work must be continued by each
succeeding relief. When a new unit takes its
turn in the trenches the orders and plans of
new works are turned over to its commander.</p>

<p class='c008'><b>Arms, Equipment, and Ammunition.</b> Full
equipment will always be worn in the firing
trench, except the haversack, water bottle, and
entrenching tool. In the support and reserve
trenches the equipment to be worn is subject
to the will of the sector commander. Every
man will always carry a gas mask in any part
of the position and even as far to the rear as
ten miles.</p>

<p class='c008'>The men in the firing line and in the doubling
trenches will at all times be in possession of
their rifles and bayonets. The rifles of men
in the support and reserve trenches may be
kept in protected racks in the same shelter
as the men.</p>

<p class='c008'>All rifles must be kept scrupulously clean
at all times.</p>

<p class='c008'>Ammunition is protected from bad weather
<span class='pageno' id='Page_75'>75</span>by being placed in boxes located in the sides
of the trenches.</p>

<p class='c008'>Ten to twenty hand grenades are placed in
a sandbag. These are usually kept at the
depot and carried in these quantities for the
supply of the fire trench in combat. One or
two of such sandbags are kept at a bombing
post.</p>

<p class='c008'>Special care must be taken to keep rockets
in good condition. Supplies are kept in the
fire line (platoon leaders’ posts, observations)
and at points in the rear (in the observatories
or different command posts or in the observation
posts of the information service).</p>

<p class='c008'><b>Depots and Supply.</b> (<i>a</i>) Depots:—There
should be one general depot in each area located
near the command post of the chief of
area. However, in order to facilitate work
in the first line the platoon leaders may establish
near their post a small depot of tools and
material being used for the time being. The
importance of the depot depends upon the
area it is to supply. For example, the depot
of the garrison of a support point in the first
line would contain:</p>

  <dl class='dl_2'>
    <dt>20,000</dt>
    <dd>cartridges
    </dd>
    <dt> 1,000</dt>
    <dd>hand grenades
    </dd>
    <dt>   400</dt>
    <dd>rifle grenades
<div><span class='pageno' id='Page_76'>76</span></div>
    </dd>
    <dt>100</dt>
    <dd>each—signal and illuminating rockets
    </dd>
    <dt> 60</dt>
    <dd>to 70 gas masks
    </dd>
    <dt>100</dt>
    <dd>shovels
    </dd>
    <dt>100</dt>
    <dd>picks
    </dd>
    <dt>&nbsp;</dt>
    <dd>Sandbags, planks, barbed wire, etc.
    </dd>
    </dl>

<p class='c008'>The depot at the center of resistance contains
the same articles but in greater number,
also telephone wire, blankets, and three days’
rations of food.</p>

<p class='c008'>The main depot of the position, however,
is the one near the command post of the leader
of the sector. It is divided into three parts:</p>

<p class='c008'>1. Ammunition and rocket signals (Ordnance
Service).</p>

<p class='c008'>2. Material of every sort (Engineer Service).</p>

<p class='c008'>3. Food and clothing (Quartermaster
Service).</p>

<p class='c008'>The different services in the rear of the position
maintain the supplies of the sector depot.
The amount of ammunition to be carried is
fixed by orders from the general and this
amount must be strictly maintained.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id002'>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_77'>77</span>
<img src='images/i_b_077.jpg' alt='_Organization of Supply System._' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_78'>78</span>(<i>b</i>) Requests for Supplies: Each morning
the chiefs of areas send in a request for material
required for the next night’s work.
All these requests in a sector are grouped by
a staff officer under the heads of the three
different services. Along with each request
must go the information showing necessity
for same. Emergency requests are made by
telephone. The officer making request for
material must be on hand to receive and check
the same upon delivery.</p>

<p class='c008'>(<i>c</i>) Supply Parties: The supply of the
depot is usually made with special detachments
taken from the support or reserve companies.
If it is necessary to take men from
the front trenches for this purpose, no more
than 10% can be taken away from these
trenches at the same time. Complete units
will be used as supply parties with their
leader if possible. Upon each battalion in a
C. of R. and upon each regimental reserve
falls part of the responsibility of distributing
supplies in the rear of the sector. The
unloading or rendezvous points are disposed
along what is called the supply line, usually
on a road, path, ravine, behind a hill, etc.
Supply parties sent out at night to these
points make as little noise as possible. They
return along a well-picketed path, usually
running along one of the central boyaux.
Transportation is thus carried in the open
ground as far as possible, usually to the support
line.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_79'>79</span>When proper protection is possible, pack
trains are used to carry supplies right through
the distributing point and up to the depots of
the sector.</p>

<p class='c008'>(<i>d</i>) Cooking: The battalion kitchens are
located behind the sector in a protected emplacement.
Steps must be taken to ensure as
little smoke as possible being seen from them.
At night each platoon sends a ration party to
the kitchen.</p>

<p class='c008'>When the regiment has rolling kitchens,
these are brought up part of the way towards
the sector where they meet the ration party.
Arrangements should be made to always have,
if possible, some hot soup or drink available
for the men between midnight and 4 a. m.</p>

<p class='c008'>(<i>a</i>) Activities of the Troops: Sector duties
include a considerable amount of work, and
are not only useful from a tactical point of
view, but are also indispensable for the moral
and physical welfare of the troops. Men
without occupation in the trenches stagnate,
grow slack, and think only of the time when
their relief will arrive. Such troops lose their
aggressiveness, so that when the time for the
offensive arrives they have no confidence
and cannot deliver the proper blow.</p>

<p class='c008'>Good practice to obtain fruitful results is
the employment of time as follows: In
<span class='pageno' id='Page_80'>80</span>each company the captain prepares a daily
schedule of duties in which he allots the different
services of the strong point: hours of
“standing to” and inspection, of sending ration
and supply parties, time of rest, of cleaning
arms, equipment, and clothing, time of
trench work, etc. This schedule is communicated
daily to each platoon at a regular hour.</p>

<p class='c008'>(<i>b</i>) Discipline in the Trenches:—Life in the
trenches is not especially dangerous when all
precautions are observed. In the presence of
an alert enemy, every faulty move of disposition
receives its punishment, such as the improper
concealment of a movement, poorly
hidden trench work, or useless noise in the
firing line. Silence is one of the essential rules
of the trench. Silence in a sector in which
troops are properly disciplined enables the
chief to rapidly transmit his orders and the
men to accomplish same without delay.</p>

<p class='c008'>Daily Reports:—In each sector, from the
captain up, the different commanders must
furnish a daily report. These are co-ordinated
in the headquarters of the sector
commander, and afterwards sent to the division
headquarters.</p>

<p class='c008'>(<i>a</i>) Telephone Reports:—</p>

<table class='table1' summary='Telephone Reports'>
  <tr>
    <td class='c017'>Night report.</td>
    <td class='c019'>5 a. m. to 7 a. m.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class='c017'>Day report.</td>
    <td class='c019'>3 p. m. to 5 p. m.</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_81'>81</span>These reports contain the main events of
the time covered. Similar messages are sent
at any time important events occur, such as
heavy shelling, important information of the
enemy, activities in the air, etc.</p>

<p class='c008'>(<i>b</i>) Written Reports:—The daily morning
written reports contain the following paragraphs.</p>

<p class='c008'>1. General aspect of the sector.</p>

<p class='c008'>2. Important events of the day.</p>

<p class='c008'>(The events must be reported in detail, for
example: A report of shelling must contain
the details as to the area bombarded, the caliber
of the gun used, and the time and direction
of same, etc.)</p>

<p class='c008'>3. Casualties (wounded, killed, and missing).</p>

<p class='c008'>4. Consumption of ammunition.</p>

<p class='c008'>5. Requests for miscellaneous equipment
and material.</p>

<p class='c008'>This report is signed by the chiefs of the
area responsible for the information in the
report. Along with this official report is
added a second written report with the following
paragraphs:</p>

<p class='c008'>1. Request for materials for the night.</p>

<p class='c008'>2. Observation and information reports
(to the Intelligence Officer).</p>

<p class='c008'>3. Report of all the work done in the sector,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_82'>82</span>including time schedule of the center of
resistance.</p>

<h4 class='c016'>Use of Infantry and Artillery Weapons, and Liaison</h4>

<p class='c014'><b>Machine Guns.</b> The tactical use and location
of machine guns in the sector depends
upon the following two points:</p>

<p class='c008'>(<i>a</i>) Machine gun emplacements must be
thoroughly concealed and during the bombardment
the M. G. itself is kept under cover
in a dugout. Previous to an attack of the
enemy, his artillery searches the position for
the destruction of the machine guns and their
emplacements, because they are the most
powerful weapons of the defense.</p>

<p class='c008'>If invisible casemates can be constructed
this practice is good. The best method is,
however, to prepare several emplacements,
properly camouflaged, with a deep dugout
near at hand for the protection of the M. G.
and its crew. This shelter must be located at
such a point that the M. G. can be quickly
brought out to any one of its emplacements
when the attack develops. These emplacements
usually are simple pits located in front
of the trench and connected with the dugout
by a gallery. When emplacements are destroyed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_83'>83</span>by hostile artillery fire, or when they
are not possible, machine guns are pushed into
shell holes or operated on the open ground.
Shell holes out in front give the best service as
emplacements for a daring M. G. crew. The
French success at Verdun depended to a great
extent upon the judicious use of shell holes for
M. G. flanking fire.</p>

<p class='c008'>(<i>b</i>) Machine guns are not only located in
the first line, but are disposed throughout the
interior of the position. The hostile artillery
may entirely destroy the first line of defenses,
but the proper disposition of machine guns
for flanking fire in the interior lines will prevent
the enemy’s progress after penetrating
the position. Machine guns are so located
in the position as to cover all the space
between the different lines with flanking
fire. Usually three pickets define the sector
to be covered by any one M. G., one
at the M. G. and two limiting its sector of
fire.</p>

<p class='c008'>In a sector, ⅓ of the machine guns are
located in, or near the first line, ⅓ is disposed
of in the support line or in the redoubt.
The last ⅓ is assigned to the third line. In
each line machine guns are under the command
of the chief of the area.</p>

<p class='c008'>As a general rule, in the first line, automatic-machine
<span class='pageno' id='Page_84'>84</span>rifles, because of their mobility, are
used instead of machine guns.</p>

<p class='c008'>Standing orders are, that M. G. crews will
never surrender, but fight to the last man.
Often the tenacity of a M. G. crew has permitted
the retaking of an area otherwise lost.</p>

<p class='c008'><b>Trench Mortars.</b> In each sector there are
located a certain number of trench mortars.
These are efficient weapons, but must be used
with care, because they will nearly always
draw concentrated artillery fire.</p>

<p class='c008'>They are used for the destruction of special
points in the enemy’s lines that the artillery
cannot reach.</p>

<p class='c008'>They are employed in the preparation for
an offensive against the enemy’s first line,
either for an attack or for a raid. They are
used for reply fire against enemy’s trench
mortars.</p>

<p class='c008'>They participate in establishing barrages.</p>

<p class='c008'>The efficiency of trench mortars cannot be
overestimated, but at the same time, great
precaution must be taken in their use and
concealment. The personnel required to serve
the light trench mortars are taken from
the garrison of the sector and belong to
a special headquarters unit, a platoon of
bombardiers.</p>

<p class='c008'>The large trench mortars are commanded
<span class='pageno' id='Page_85'>85</span>by an artillery officer who keeps himself
constantly in liaison with the commander of
the center of resistance. He consults the
latter on the location of his mortars and especially
upon their use. He also reports to
the commander of the center of resistance all
orders he receives from his artillery chief.
This artillery officer always works in co-operation
with the chief of his area, who in turn
gives him all necessary information and help.
Especially does the mortar commander require
help for the supply of ammunition.</p>

<h4 class='c016'>Artillery Support in a Sector</h4>

<p class='c014'><b>Composition of the Artillery Support.</b> The
light artillery of this sector is not directly
under the command of the Division Commander.
The Commanding Officer of the
light artillery, usually a Colonel, in co-operation
with the chief of the sector, divides it
into different parts, assigning one to each of
the centers of resistance. This artillery is
called support artillery. As we shall see
later this practice is usually the same in the
offensive.</p>

<p class='c008'>The amount of artillery allotted as support
depends upon the tactical situation, in other
words, the activity of the enemy.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_86'>86</span>In the Verdun and Champagne offensives
the disposition of light artillery was the same
in principle as that for the defensive, that is
to say, one troop of artillery consisting of 3
batteries was assigned to each infantry
battalion.</p>

<p class='c008'>The general use of this artillery, is:</p>

<p class='c008'>(<i>a</i>) To protect the infantry with barrage
fire.</p>

<p class='c008'>(<i>b</i>) Prosecution of destruction of the enemy’s
personnel and works.</p>

<p class='c008'><b>Tactical Liaison between Infantry and
Orderly.</b> To carry out its functions, the artillery
support must be in perfect liaison with
the infantry, and only when this is done is co-operation
of the two arms possible. This
liaison is obtained by the following five means:</p>

<p class='c008'>(<i>a</i>) Organization of Leadership:—For the
full co-operation of the infantry and artillery,
the latter is not kept entirely independent,
but is divided and assigned to infantry unit.
Each chief of sector and each chief of center of
resistance knows what artillery must support
him if he needs it. The commander of the
artillery support is not exactly under the
command of the infantry chief of area, but he
is at the latter’s disposal for certain calls for
support fire. The proper co-operation of
these two officers will give efficient results.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_87'>87</span>(<i>b</i>)  Relation between Artillery and Infantry
Commanders:—The best of relations must
be established between the artillery and infantry
commanders. Usually, it is not possible
to locate the commanding posts of the
two officers close together. Each has his
area or unit to command and for that purpose
must be located for the proper control of the
same. The support artillery commander,
however, should make frequent visits to the
infantry leader and his area. He should
also send his subordinate artillery officers
into the infantry area to become acquainted
with the first line, the conditions in “No Man’s
Land,” the enemy’s lines, and to gather all the
information possible from the infantry officers
in the trenches. Everything should be done
to foster good relations between the infantry
and their support artillery and this is best
done by frequent visits of the artillery officers
to the infantry trenches to gather information
for artillery data.</p>

<p class='c008'>(<i>c</i>) Communication of Orders:—It is necessary
that the orders received by the infantry
commander be communicated in whole or in
part to the artillery commander, and vice
versa. For instance, if the chief of area receives
orders to send out a fighting patrol or a
raid, this information is sent to the artillery
<span class='pageno' id='Page_88'>88</span>commander, who, in turn, sends back his
plan of action. Similarly, when the artillery
commander expects to carry out special fires
not called for by the infantry, such as destructive
shelling, harassing fires, etc., he
should first notify his infantry chief of area.</p>

<p class='c008'>Similarly, any useful information picked up,
either by the infantry or artillery, must be
communicated to the other. The daily report
of the chief of sector and the observation
report of the Intelligence Officer are sent direct
to the commander of the artillery support.
Valuable information obtained at the artillery
observation posts is sent to the infantry.</p>

<p class='c008'>(<i>d</i>) Means of Communication:—The principal
of the organization of the different means
of communication is such as to assure the best
liaison between the two arms. Telephone
lines, searchlight signals, runners, etc., are
established directly between a unit of infantry
and its artillery support. This is to avoid
loss of time and useless interruption between
leaders.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id002'>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_89'>89</span>
<img src='images/i_b_089.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_90'>90</span>(<i>e</i>) Detachments for Liaison and Observation:—For
more efficient liaison between the
artillery and the infantry, usually a certain
number of artillerymen are sent from the
group of the artillery Support to the infantry
in their area. Usually a special detachment
of artillerymen is sent. This detachment is
made up of one officer, chief of the detachment,
who is sent to the chief of sector, one
N. C. O. to each chief of a center of resistance,
the rest as telephone operators and artillery
orderlies. This disposition of artillerymen
in the infantry area is obligatory for an attack,
but it is so practical that it is now employed
in the sector organization.</p>

<p class='c008'>The task of these artillery officers or N. C. O.
is:—</p>

<p class='c008'>(1) To control all means of communication
with the batteries of the artillery support.</p>

<p class='c008'>(2) To transmit to the artillery the different
calls for fire, and in technical terms to give the
proper data for the laying of the pieces on the
target, and the kind of fire required.</p>

<p class='c008'><b>Use of Artillery Support.</b> Different kinds
of fire are executed by the artillery support.
The most important is the barrage.</p>

<p class='c008'><b>Barrage.</b> Purpose:—The purpose of a
barrage is to stop a hostile attack before it
can get started, or to hinder enemies’ reinforcements
or reserve troops from coming
forward.</p>

<p class='c008'>Form:—The barrage is a curtain of fire
let down in “No Man’s Land” as close in
front of your first line as possible without loss
to your own garrison. This will be about
150 or 200 yards to the front, between the two
lines of trenches.</p>

<div class='ic003'>
<p>LOCATION OF ARTILLERY FOR BARRAGE</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_92'>92</span>Front of the Barrage:—The barrage has
real value only if it is impassible. This will
be if the density of the fire is so great that
the danger zones of the explosions of the
individual shells overlap each other. The
allotting of one troop of artillery, 12 guns,
for an infantry battalion is quite sufficient
for this purpose if the front of the battalion
does not exceed the average length of from
400 to 600 yards.</p>

<p class='c008'>Duration:—The barrage is a burst of fire
which lasts from six to ten minutes. At the
beginning the fire is very rapid and towards
the end becomes slower. For instance, for
the first six minutes the fire may be six rounds
per gun and in the last four minutes, say, four
rounds per gun. Successive barrages can be
carried out depending upon the needs of the
infantry.</p>

<p class='c008'>Calling for the Barrage:—Barrage fire, for
the best results, must open up at the moment
the hostile attack begins. To accomplish
this the call for the barrage must be made by
an observer in the first line. For this reason
every officer in the first line has the authority to
call for the barrage. The barrage is the only fire
that can be called for automatically by signal.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_93'>93</span>The kind and color of the rocket signifies
the type of barrage required and the front it is
to cover. In order to avoid mistakes this
rocket signal is repeated from some point
farther to the rear, usually at the observatories
of the command post of the center of
resistance, or of the sector. Rocket signals
are repeated until the barrage fire opens.</p>

<p class='c008'>Confirmation of the barrage is given by
telephone, if possible. However, at the first
signal rocket the artillery is required to open
up the barrage fire as quickly as possible without
waiting for confirmation. Barrage fire is
at the disposal of the infantry and cannot be
refused by the commander of the artillery,
whether it is justified or not.</p>

<p class='c008'><b>Other Kinds of Artillery Fires.</b> The commanders
of the center of resistance or of the
sector may call on the artillery support for
other fires besides the barrage, such as:</p>

<p class='c008'>Reprisal fire on the enemy’s lines.</p>

<p class='c008'>Reply fire to hostile shelling.</p>

<p class='c008'>Surprise fire on supply attachments or working
parties.</p>

<p class='c008'>Destruction fire on special points.</p>

<p class='c008'>All these fires are called for by telephone,
but do not follow automatically like the
barrage fire. The artillery commander, in
such case, can use a certain amount of discretion
<span class='pageno' id='Page_94'>94</span>whether these fires should be carried out
or not. Last of all there is the counter-preparation
fire, which is a strong shelling of the
enemy’s position. It is carried out as a
reply to a methodical bombardment of the
enemy preliminary to his offensive. It is
the best means to prevent a hostile attack.
If this fire is well executed the enemy’s
assault is “killed in the egg” as the French
expression has it.</p>

<p class='c008'><b>Liaison in the Sector.</b></p>

<p class='c008'>(<i>a</i>) Telephone: There are two different
systems of telephones.</p>

<p class='c008'>First, there is the system connecting the
infantry command posts, support points,
centers of resistance, sector, and division headquarters,
with the command posts of the artillery
protecting the different infantry areas.
These are direct lines between the command
posts and the groups of support artillery.
Also, this system connects the command post
with observatories, depots, medical aid stations,
kitchens, etc.</p>

<p class='c008'>Secondly, there is the system connecting
the chief of artillery with his subordinate
commanders, the artillery observation posts,
and the artillery dumps. In this same system
the artillery command posts are again
connected with the infantry units which they
are to support. Special lines are run by the
artillery to the officer and N. C. O. of the
artillery attachment of liaison in the infantry
areas.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id001'>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_95'>95</span>
<img src='images/i_b_095.jpg' alt='_Telephone Liaison._' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_96'>96</span>Consequently, the liaison between the artillery
and the infantry is doubly provided for
in these two systems.</p>

<p class='c008'>The lines of connection between the infantry
and the artillery must be separate from
those within the infantry area and those
between the artillery commander and his
subordinate units.</p>

<p class='c008'>Confidential information should never be
telephoned except in cipher. Conventional
designations are employed to call the different
posts. Strict regulations are maintained as
to who should use the telephone and for what
purposes.</p>

<p class='c008'>The weak point of a telephone system is that
it is often broken by bombardment or earth-slides.
This can be partially remedied by
constructing as few direct lines as possible,
by burying the wires in the bottom of the
boyaux, and by executing repairs as quickly
as possible.</p>

<p class='c008'>(<i>b</i>) Wireless and Ground Telegraphy: The
battalions in the first line have ground telegraph
apparatus connecting them with the
regimental headquarters, and these, in turn,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_97'>97</span>can communicate with the general headquarters
by wireless. This means of communication
is only employed when the
telephone cannot be used.</p>

<p class='c008'>(<i>c</i>) Signalling: It is difficult to establish
signal communication within the sector without
being seen by the enemy. However, at
night with flashlights it is possible, especially
in hilly country, to communicate from front
to rear within the position. The receiving
post should be able to certify received
messages. When practicable, communications
should be established between the
command post of the center of resistance
and the sector command posts, and from the
latter post to the artillery. This method
of liaison is organized as a duplicating
means or as a temporary substitute for the
telephone.</p>

<p class='c008'>(<i>d</i>) Rockets: Signal rockets are used to
communicate with the rear. Different forms
and colors of rockets are used to signify different
things. As we have seen, the most important
use of the rocket is to signal for barrage
fire. It is often necessary to relay a rocket
signal from a second position in the rear to
make absolutely sure that it reaches the
artillery support.</p>

<p class='c008'>Signal rockets are also used to communicate
<span class='pageno' id='Page_98'>98</span>with aëroplanes, but this means is usually
only employed during an attack.</p>

<p class='c008'>(<i>e</i>) Runners: The liaison established with
runners is best of all, from the point of view
that it usually never fails. During heavy
shelling it is the only sure means of communication.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id001'>
<img src='images/i_b_098.jpg' alt='_Example of a Chain of Runners._' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c008'>The ordinary messengers or orderlies are
not used as runners. A chain of trained runners
is used, located in a little post, shelters,
or shell holes; Each post contains three
runners, their distance being from 150 to 300
yards apart. Each runner is selected from
the unit located near the next post in the chain,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_99'>99</span>that is, the one to which he is to run. Often
the divisional cavalry furnish these runners.</p>

<p class='c008'>The chain of runners is under the command
of a N. C. O. who is responsible for its efficiency.
He has an important task on his hands.
He must assure himself that every runner
knows, not only his two neighboring posts,
but also the general direction of the chain.
He must change disabled runners and fill
gaps in his chain. It becomes his duty to
instill into the runners the importance of their
duty.</p>

<p class='c008'>(<i>f</i>) Carrier Pigeons: Carrier pigeons are the
last means of communication. They have
been found to give excellent service during
heavy shelling or gas attacks. They do not
fly very easily at night.</p>

<p class='c008'>Each command post of a center of resistance
in the first line has a pigeon post. These
consist of two reliefs of men, four pigeons,
and the necessary equipment and food. The
pigeons themselves have to be relieved every
few days. The care given to the birds at the
command posts must not be as good as that
at the dovecot in the rear, so that when they
are released they will return immediately to
the latter place, from where the message is
delivered to its proper destination.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_100'>100</span>
  <h4 class='c016'>Instructions for Sentinel, Watcher, and Observer</h4>
</div>

<p class='c014'><b>Sentinel.</b> A sentinel is a soldier placed in
the first line or in an advanced post for the
purpose of security.</p>

<p class='c008'>The duty of the sentinel is to watch and
guard against hostile attack and to warn the
chief of the platoon of every action of the
enemy in “No Man’s Land.”</p>

<p class='c008'>At night, one sentinel is posted about every
ten yards in the firing trench. During the
day, only a sufficient number are posted to
assure that all parts of the enemy’s line and
“No Man’s Land” are observed.</p>

<p class='c008'>Sentinels are relieved every two hours except
under bad weather conditions when the length
of the tour of duty is reduced. Every sentinel
is regularly posted by a non-commissioned
officer who explains to him his duties and
ascertains that both the sentinel and his
relief are aware of the position of the platoon
commanders and of the sentinels, on either
side.</p>

<p class='c008'>At night, the sentinels must observe over
the parapet. As little challenging as possible
is done and then only in a very low voice.
If the sentinel receives no answer to his
challenge, he shoots, thus giving the alarm.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_101'>101</span>During the day, the sentinel uses a periscope
or observes through a loophole.</p>

<p class='c008'>The sentinel always has the bayonet fixed
on his rifle, which is loaded and ready for use.
He must be on the alert for every noise, and
for this reason he is not allowed to wear any
ear covering.</p>

<p class='c008'>Sentinels must be informed of the sending
out of patrols, the approximate hour of departure
and return, and the general direction
that the patrol is to follow.</p>

<p class='c008'><b>Watcher.</b> Each platoon in the trenches,
from the first line to the rear, must have some
watchers, whose duty it is to give the alarm
both day and night against attack. These
watchers do not observe the enemy as do the
sentinels. They walk in the trench in which
the platoon is placed, especially at the entrance
of the dugouts or shelters occupied by
this platoon. When they hear a signal of
alarm given by a sentinel or by a messenger,
they wake the platoon as quickly as possible.
In general, they give to the chief of the platoon
all the information that they have obtained
during the time of their duty. When
an officer or private from another sector enters
the trench, it is the duty of the watchers to
ascertain the purpose of his visit. Watchers
receive special orders to give the alarm against
<span class='pageno' id='Page_102'>102</span>a gas attack, and must sound the alarm gongs
and bells for this purpose.</p>

<p class='c008'>The watcher may have his rifle, without
bayonet, resting on the side of the trench at
the entrance of a dugout.</p>

<p class='c008'><b>Observer.</b> The observers are specially
trained men whose duty is to observe the
hostile position and to gain all the information
that they can obtain of the enemy’s activities.</p>

<p class='c008'>Each man in the company can be used as a
sentinel or as a watcher, but not all as observers.
To become an observer, a man must
have a special capacity for this task. Each
platoon should have at least six such observers
of proper qualification; good eyesight and
hearing, patient, and a good shot. They are
relieved every two hours. Observation duty
is carried out in daylight.</p>

<p class='c008'>The observers are of two kinds:</p>

<p class='c008'>(1) In each company the platoon observers
are distributed in a number of observation
posts especially chosen for this purpose.
These posts are located in the support point
of the company which may be in advance of
the firing line, in the firing line, or in any
point within the position that has a wide view
of the front. These observers employ periscopes
or field glasses. Everything of note
that is observed is recorded and from this
<span class='pageno' id='Page_103'>103</span>data the captain makes out his daily observation
report.</p>

<p class='c008'>(2) Also, in the sector, there are special
observatories belonging to the headquarters
of the regiment, under the command of the
intelligence officer of the sector. There are
usually two or three observatories, from which
the information is transmitted directly to the
colonel. These observatories are furnished
with field glasses, maps, and telephones.</p>

<p class='c008'>In general, all observers are required to
obtain all possible information of the enemy,
to record all modifications of the hostile position
in its works and wire entanglements, all
the movements that they can observe, all
working parties that they can discover. Also,
they receive special orders for the cases they
must report to the commander, as for instance:
shelling of the position by artillery
or trench mortars, gas attacks, signal rockets
fired in the front line, activities of the aviation
services, whether of friend or enemy.</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER IV<br /> THE RELIEF</h2>
</div>

<div class="section"></div>
<h3 class='c013'>I. Definitions and Principles</h3>

<p class='c014'>There are two kinds of reliefs, General and
Interior reliefs.</p>

<p class='c008'>A <b>General Relief</b> is one where a large unit,
such as a division or an army corps, is relieved
from its position on the front.</p>

<p class='c008'>An <b>Interior Relief</b> is one where a small unit,
such as a company, battalion, or regiment, is
relieved from its area by another unit of the
same division within the position.</p>

<p class='c008'>A general relief takes place for the following
reasons:</p>

<p class='c008'>In order to send a unit far to the rear to
good billets for complete rest and perhaps for
recruiting.</p>

<p class='c008'>To withdraw and gather together the units
of a corps, for the purpose of training for an
offensive.</p>

<p class='c008'>To permit the strategical movement of large
units along the entire front.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id001'>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_105'>105</span>
<img src='images/i_b_105.jpg' alt='_Interior Relief in the Division_' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_106'>106</span>General reliefs should not be made any
oftener than necessary as they hinder methodical
and continuous organization of the
defense, observation of the enemy, and the
preparation of contemplated offensives. It
is for the express purpose of decreasing the
number of general reliefs that troops are disposed
in depth in a position so that continuous
defense of the sector will be assured by
means of successive interior reliefs. As an
example of interior reliefs, we will consider a
division holding a part of the front with two
regiments disposed in the first position, one
regiment near the second position in billets,
and the fourth still farther to the rear in complete
rest. These regiments, by a system of
interior reliefs, will rotate to equalize the
tours of duty in the first position. Similarly
the battalions of the regiments in the first
position will rotate to give equal divisions of
time to each in the first lines. Assuming that
a period of six to eight days spent in the front
line is a fair average, and considering the fact
that troops are disposed in depth throughout
the three lines, different combinations of
reliefs are possible. The work of making out
the schedule of reliefs falls upon a division of
the general headquarters.</p>

<p class='c008'>The sector period is variable with the activity
<span class='pageno' id='Page_107'>107</span>of the enemy and conditions of life in
the trenches. During the German offensive
at Verdun the sector period was four days,
while in Lorraine during that time the same
size unit could remain in the trenches for
three months without necessity of relief.</p>

<div class="section"></div>
<h3 class='c013'>II. Preliminary Dispositions for the Relief</h3>

<p class='c014'><b>Time to Prepare the Relief.</b> Usually the
order for the relief is issued from the general
headquarters to the regiment forty-eight
hours previous to its execution. Sometimes,
however, for tactical reasons, such time cannot
be allowed and the regiment may have to
go immediately into the trenches. In such
case, the different operations of the relief,
which are taken up in this chapter, are shortened
but must not be carelessly executed.
In the present condition of trench warfare
the proper execution of a relief is of the
greatest importance.</p>

<p class='c008'><b>Preparation.</b> A relief is executed at night.
Thirty-six hours before the relief is made the
men of the relieving units proceed to clean
and get in shape their arms, equipment, and
clothing. When the relief is not for a special
offensive operation, the troops go into the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_108'>108</span>trenches with full equipment. All non-regulation
articles are left behind with the
regimental train, in care of the non-commissioned
officer left with it. Also,
the files, books, and official papers of the
unit are left here. The regimental train
establishes itself in rear of the sector of its
regiment.</p>

<p class='c008'>Besides this material preparation, the
officers of the relieving companies are responsible
for the morale of their troops.
Before going into the trenches there may be
some apprehension on the part of the troops,
which must be dispelled by the officers.
The great factor of depression is the mystery
of what is not known of the sector about to be
entered. Platoon leaders and company
officers try to clear up this difficulty by telling
their men what is known of the sector they
are going to hold, and otherwise speaking
words of encouragement.</p>

<p class='c008'><b>Reconnaissance.</b> Prior to taking over a
sector, a preliminary reconnaissance is made
by a certain number of officers and orderlies.
They are:</p>

<p class='c008'>For the Regiment—The colonel and part of
his headquarters staff (adjutant, intelligence
officer, telephone officer, engineer officer,
medical officer, supply officer).</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_109'>109</span>For the Battalion—The battalion commander
and his adjutant.</p>

<p class='c008'>For the Companies—The company commander
and one officer for each company.
Machine gun company commander and one
machine gun officer. The commander of
the 37 mm. gun platoon.</p>

<p class='c008'>Messengers and telephone men at the discretion
of the adjutant and the company
commanders.</p>

<p class='c008'>The above reconnaissance parties will go
into the trenches on the morning of the day
preceding the night relief. They must
start early enough to permit a certain
number of officers of these parties to return
to the billets with all details and information
necessary for the movement of
the relief into the sector. The adjutant
and the lieutenants of each company remain
in the trenches until the relief arrives. During
the intervening time they must acquaint
themselves with all details of the
sector necessary for the execution of its
defense.</p>

<p class='c008'>This preliminary reconnaissance affords
an opportunity to the different leaders and
chiefs of services to note the particular things
of interest to each.</p>

<p class='c008'>For the Colonel or Battalion Commander—The
<span class='pageno' id='Page_110'>110</span>general organization and defense of their
area.</p>

<p class='c008'>For the Adjutants—The works under construction,
precautions against gas attacks,
etc.</p>

<p class='c008'>For Officers of the Regimental Headquarters
Co.—Information as follows:</p>

<p class='c008'>Information Service—Activity of the
enemy, microphones, observation posts and
observatories, carrier pigeon posts, signal
rockets.</p>

<p class='c008'>Telegraph Service—Telephone systems,
flashlight posts, wireless or ground telegraphy
installations.</p>

<p class='c008'>Engineer and Ordnance Service—Depots
and supply (material and ammunition), special
engineer works, trench mortar emplacements.</p>

<p class='c008'>Medical Service—Dressing stations, evacuation
of the wounded, hygiene (latrines, etc.).</p>

<p class='c008'>Supply Officer—Emplacements of the
kitchens, food supply.</p>

<p class='c008'>For the Company Commander—Location
of the platoons (number of men holding the
first line and distribution of same; platoons
in the cover trench and support line). Shelter
accommodations, alarm signals, artillery support
(limits of barrage fronts and barrage
calls). Counter attacks (troops and directions
for counter attacks). Information of the enemy
<span class='pageno' id='Page_111'>111</span>(observation posts of the support point).
Supply (engineer dumps, kitchens, ration
supply parties, water).</p>

<p class='c008'>For the Machine Gun Company Commander—Distribution
of machine guns and
emplacements, limits of machine gun fire
sectors, emergency and special uses of M. G.</p>

<p class='c008'>When such a complete reconnaissance
cannot be made, only commanders of units
precede their troops and make a short reconnaissance
of one or two hours.</p>

<h4 class='c016'>Relief Orders</h4>

<p class='c014'>(1) <b>Regimental Orders.</b> Usually the general
order for the relief of a sector is settled on in
conference by the colonels of the relieving and
relieved regiments. This order is sent to the
battalion commanders, if possible, before the
reconnaissance.</p>

<p class='c008'>The order of relief contains the following
paragraphs:</p>

<p class='c008'>Day and hour of the relief, designating
the relieving and relieved units.</p>

<p class='c008'>The name, limits, and division of the
sector with designations of the neighboring
units.</p>

<p class='c008'>Information of the artillery support, its
composition and emplacements.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_112'>112</span>Orders for the reconnaissance, its composition,
and the hour when it must be
finished.</p>

<p class='c008'>Orders for the movement of the relief;
march of the regiment from the initial point
to the point of dispersion where the battalions
branch off to their particular areas.
If the regiment is transported in motor
trucks, points and orders for entraining and
detraining. Hours of departure of each
battalion from the dispersion point and
special itineraries for each.</p>

<p class='c008'>Movement of the relieved troops. Assembly

<p class='c008'>Hour at which the new colonel takes
command of the sector.</p>

<p class='c008'>(2) <b>Battalion Orders.</b> All details for the
relief are fixed in the battalion relief order
issued by the battalion commander. This
order is sent out immediately upon his return
from the preliminary reconnaissance and in
accordance with the regimental order.</p>

<p class='c008'>The battalion relief order contains the following
points:</p>

<p class='c008'>Hour of leaving the dispersion point.</p>

<p class='c008'><b>Departure.</b> Before departure, each company
is inspected by its company commander,
who must see that each man has his canteen
full, his rations for the day, a full supply of
cartridges, the magazine of his rifle loaded
(no cartridges in the chamber), and his gas
mask in good condition. In winter the relieving
troops will find a supply of blankets
and trench boots in the sector. Usually each
man should carry an extra supply of cartridges
above that laid down by regulation, and two
sandbags. There should be a certain number
of flashlights and candles to the company
<span class='pageno' id='Page_115'>115</span>(each corporal carrying a minimum of two
candles). Just previous to departure or entraining
the battalion commander himself
makes a general inspection of his unit.</p>

<div class="section"></div>
<h3 class='c013'>III. Movement of the Relief</h3>

<p class='c014'><b>March to the Rendezvous Point of the
Guides.</b> Usually the regiment marches, but
it is sometimes transported in motor trucks,
up to a point in the rear of the sector, called
the point of dispersion, from which the different
battalions branch off successively to go
to their respective areas. This practice
avoids the crossing of units. A short meal
may be had by the regiment at the point of
dispersion. The distance of this point behind
the sector and the time of arrival of the relieving
unit must be carefully calculated so
that the relief may be finished early enough to
permit the unit relieved to get out of sight of
the enemy before daylight.</p>

<p class='c008'>When the battalions leave the rendezvous
point, each company sends to the battalion
headquarters two messengers for the purpose
of liaison. The units now follow the prescribed
itineraries up to the rendezvous point
where the guides are met.</p>

<p class='c008'><b>Guides.</b> During the reconnaissance, the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_116'>116</span>company to be relieved details certain men to
act as guides for the incoming company.
An average of two guides is furnished for
each platoon, one for each company headquarters,
and one for each battalion headquarters.
These guides await the arrival of
the different units at a certain point called the
rendezvous point of the guides. Usually
this point is at the entrance of the boyau.
As several guides are usually grouped at the
same rendezvous point, they must be alert
to meet the unit to which they are assigned.
A non-commissioned officer of the retiring
battalion is in charge of this group and he is
responsible that each guide finds his unit.
Each guide, of course, must know the best
and safest route by which to conduct the unit
to the position it must occupy.</p>

<p class='c008'><b>March in the Boyaux.</b> From the rendezvous
point, the companies continue their
march in the boyaux which are assigned to
them. One guide leads each platoon while
the second guide brings up its rear. The
leading guide must inform the platoon commander
of the different points of interest that
are passed, such as each line of the sector,
regimental or battalion command posts,
depots, water points, etc.</p>

<p class='c008'>The march in the narrow boyau of an unknown
<span class='pageno' id='Page_117'>117</span>sector, in the darkness, and with full
equipment, is difficult and depressing. Consequently,
the rate of march must be slow.
When the head of the column meets an obstacle,
a warning word is passed to the rear
along the single file. This rule is above all
useful to prevent accident to telephone wires.</p>

<p class='c008'>The march must be executed without noise.
Orders are given in low tones. Smoking or
the use of flashlights is prohibited. No
disciplinary measure is too severe that will
prevent the enemy from discovering the relief.
It is absolutely prohibited to talk over the
telephone concerning a relief otherwise than
in cipher.</p>

<div class="section"></div>
<h3 class='c013'>IV. Occupation of the Position</h3>

<p class='c014'><b>Details of the Relief.</b> If the two units
have the same number of men, the relieving
of one unit by the other is simple enough.
But often the relief is complicated by the fact
that either the extent of front or the number
of effectives is different. In such a case, the
officers of the two units must settle, during
the reconnaissance, upon the necessary modifications
for an effective and expeditious
relief.</p>

<p class='c008'>When the company arrives at the command
<span class='pageno' id='Page_118'>118</span>post of the captain, the platoons are relieved
from right to left in the first line, then in the
cover trench in the same order. If there is a
platoon in the support line this is next relieved.</p>

<p class='c008'>In the first line, the relief of the platoons is
executed in two parts. First of all, the sentinels,
observers, watchers, men in the listening
posts, and the N. C. O. of the watch are
relieved. When this is done, the remaining
men of the platoon are relieved. The men of
the old platoon occupy their places at “Stand
To.” The relieving platoon files in and steps
up on the firing step. At the command
“Pass” which is given quietly, the old and new
platoons change places.</p>

<p class='c008'>Each retiring leader, of whatever command
he may be, hands over his orders and information
to the corresponding leader who relieves
him. For example, one platoon leader will
turn over to the other all information concerning
guard duty, defense of the line, condition
of the barbed wire entanglements, patrolling,
and shelter accommodations. This must be
executed rapidly but with precision.</p>

<p class='c008'>The platoon relieved assembles at the
entrance to the boyau, and leaves the trenches
under the chief of platoon. This is not done,
however, until the platoon leader has reported
to his captain, by means of his guides, the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_119'>119</span>execution of the relief. The old captain
fixes a point for the assembling of his platoons,
but this point must be far enough to the rear
to avoid blocking of the boyaux and out of
reach of hostile grenade and trench mortar
fire.</p>

<p class='c008'>In the meantime, at the command post of
the support point, the new captain acquaints
himself with all information and orders pertaining
to the support point from the old
captain. When this is finished he telephones
the command post of the center of resistance
the completion of the relief, and asks if his
predecessor may retire. The relieved company
then takes up the march, following the
prescribed route up to the assembly point of
the battalion.</p>

<p class='c008'>It may be stated here that the relieved units
must leave their trenches in as clean and
sanitary a condition as possible. The work
of clearing up the shelters and latrines must
be thoroughly done before the arrival of the
new units. Depots must be left in good condition
and contain the amount of supplies
called for by regulations. The platoon commander
is responsible that his men do not
forget, tools and cooking utensils in the
trenches.</p>

<p class='c008'><b>Duties after the Relief.</b> In each support
<span class='pageno' id='Page_120'>120</span>point, the new captain immediately establishes
liaison with the command posts of the
neighboring units to right and left. Communication
between the captain and his battalion
commander is obtained by means of the
two messengers detailed to the battalion for
that purpose and who now return to their
company.</p>

<p class='c008'>When the battalion commander has received
the information from all his captains
that the relief of his area is finished, he reports
the same by telephone to his colonel.
A confirmation of this report will be made the
next morning in his daily written report which
will cover the following points:</p>

<p class='c023'>The general condition of the relief.</p>

<p class='c023'>Hour of completion of the relief.</p>

<p class='c023'>Casualties during the relief.</p>

<p class='c023'>Living conditions in the trenches.</p>

<p class='c023'>Requests for tactical modifications (new
dispositions of the garrison).</p>

<p class='c008'>The relief finished, the battalion commander
must also establish his liaison laterally and to
the front and rear, but especially with his
artillery support, by means of the artillery
N. C. O. detailed to his area for that purpose.</p>

<p class='c008'>Finally, the battalion commander investigates
and perfects the organization of the
food supply.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_121'>121</span>In the sector headquarters, the new sector
commander will find on file all records, reports,
orders, and detailed information concerning
all the elements of defense of the sector. The
sector file will contain the following documents:</p>

<p class='c023'>Plan of organization.</p>

<p class='c023'>Plan of defense.</p>

<p class='c023'>Files of information concerning:</p>

<p class='c023'>Machine guns.</p>

<p class='c023'>Trench mortars.</p>

<p class='c023'>Artillery support (table of barrages and
other fires).</p>

<p class='c023'>Liaison (telephones, runners, signalling,
etc.).</p>

<p class='c023'>Supply and evacuation.</p>

<p class='c023'>Measures to combat gas attacks.</p>

<p class='c008'>Besides these are the files of the different
reports:</p>

<p class='c023'>Sector daily reports (kept by the adjutant).</p>

<p class='c023'>Intelligence reports (kept by the intelligence
officer).</p>

<p class='c023'>Construction reports (kept by the engineer
officer).</p>

<p class='c023'>Maps, sketches, and aëroplane photographs
(kept by int. officer).</p>

<p class='c023'>Inventory of the sector depot (kept by
engineer officer).</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_122'>122</span>Any officer of the sector, as for example a
machine gun officer, has access to this file to
more thoroughly acquaint himself for the
execution of his duties.</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER V<br /> DEFENSE OF A POSITION</h2>
</div>

<div class="section"></div>
<h3 class='c013'>Different Kinds of Hostile Attacks</h3>

<p class='c014'><b>Surprise Attacks.</b> These may be raids or
local attacks. A raid is usually for the
purpose of taking prisoners; and a local
attack, to capture a part of the line.
These operations may be carried out
without a preliminary bombardment, but
are usually preceded by a short intense
bombardment to destroy wire entanglements.</p>

<p class='c008'><b>Attacks in Force.</b> Such an attack may
be made on a larger part of the line, as a
particular sector, or on a considerable length
of front in a general offensive. This kind
of attack is, of course, preceded by a bombardment.</p>

<p class='c008'><b>Special Attacks.</b> Special attacks are made
with gas, liquid fire, and mine methods.
These will be taken up in detail in a later
chapter.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_124'>124</span>
  <h4 class='c016'>Surprise Attacks</h4>
</div>

<p class='c014'><b>Precautions Against Surprise.</b> In considering
precautions against surprise attacks,
it is not a question of combating patrols or
enemy’s reconnaissance parties whose missions
are to search out information of your
intentions and situation. It is a question of
raids and little attacks on your lines. Against
such hostile operations the defense of the
sector depends upon the following precautions.</p>

<p class='c008'><b>Maintenance of the Barbed Wire Entanglements.</b>
A surprise attack, to be successful,
must have besides surprise the element of
swiftness. The enemy must make a dash
across “No Man’s Land” up to your first line.
This, however, is impossible, if your barbed
wire entanglements are intact. Consequently
each captain is responsible for the maintenance
of the wire belt in front of his line.</p>

<p class='c008'>It is the duty of the observation service to
discover breaches or defects in your wire.
To this end, the captain sends out at night
patrols to ascertain the condition of his entanglements.
If necessary, small detachments
are sent out at night to make repairs.
If this work is considerable, he calls upon the
battalion commander for special working
parties to assist. The captain, in his daily
<span class='pageno' id='Page_125'>125</span>requisitions for material, provides for the
supply of wire, chevaux-de-frise, etc., that he
may need.</p>

<p class='c008'><b>Service of Guard and Observation.</b> One
of the most important duties of the observers
in the first line, and of the sentinels and patrols,
is to locate breaches that the enemy has made
in your wire, or to discover hostile parties in
the act of tampering with the same.</p>

<p class='c008'>Breaches or passages in your wire may
be made by such means as bangalores and
petards and detonators. The explosion of
such an arrangement is a sufficient signal of
alarm. These are usually poor methods.</p>

<p class='c008'>Passages may be made by special hostile
patrols using wire cutters. These wire cutting
patrols may precede the attack. Alert
sentinels or your own hourly patrols, that
crawl along your wire belt, should discover
such operations.</p>

<p class='c008'>The usual method, however, is to destroy
barbed wire by artillery fire. The object of
hostile shelling of your position is not always
easily detected. The enemy may carry out a
general artillery fire on your position during
the day, for example, just before dusk. At
the same time he will concentrate certain batteries
for a methodical destruction of parts of
your entanglement. For this reason it is the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_126'>126</span>mission of the first patrol, sent out at dusk, to
ascertain the condition of the barbed wire belt.
The report of this patrol may carry important
indications of the intentions of the enemy.</p>

<p class='c008'>Sometimes a hostile surprise attack is
preceded only by a short and unexpected
bombardment. Registering shots for this
artillery fire are made during the day. These
registering shots, however, are fired short of
the wire in “No Man’s Land” to deceive the
observers that they are for the purpose of
barrage control. In this case, the only means
to baffle the attack is to have diligent sentinels
to give immediate alarm, and a well-trained
garrison to take its place in the fire trenches
quickly.</p>

<p class='c008'><b>“Stand To” Exercises.</b> A well-trained
garrison, accustomed to “stand to” quickly,
without noise and confusion, cannot be easily
surprised. When the call to arms is given by
a sentinel, this call is repeated by all watchers
in the successive lines of the support point.
The officer of the watch runs immediately
to the place of call. All the men of the garrison
spring out of their niches and shelters,
and proceed quickly, without orders, to their
appointed places of combat. This execution
must be automatic, and only a frequent repetition
of the “stand to” exercise can give a
unit this result. Besides these exercises, as
we know, the garrison executes “stand to”
one hour before dusk and one hour before
daylight. Deep dugouts are prohibited in the
first line because they may become traps in
which the defenders are taken prisoners,
and they materially lengthen the time for the
garrison to take its place for combat.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id002'>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_127'>127</span>
<img src='images/i_b_127.jpg' alt='POSITION OF SPECIALISTS AT “STAND TO”' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_128'>128</span>Only in case of an expected attack and when
the garrison is ready for it, is the alarm signal
given by such special means as bells, whistles, or
rockets. This is exceptional. The only practical
alarm signal that will awaken the garrison
any time during the night is the cry “to arms”
passed along and taken up by everyone.</p>

<p class='c008'>Rifle, A. M. R., and grenade fire from the
first line will usually stop a surprise attack.
But since it is impossible to ascertain the
strength of the attacking troops, the defensive
artillery barrage is called for. Similarly, the
reserve troops located in the cover and support
trenches may be used for the purposes of
reinforcement and counterattacks, depending
upon the success of the enemy’s attack.</p>

<p class='c008'>The captain of a support point must not
only keep up the offensive spirit of his garrison
by all the means of trench fighting, but he
must organize and maintain a vigilant guard
and patrol service for security.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_129'>129</span>
  <h4 class='c016'>Attack in Force</h4>
</div>

<p class='c014'>Attacks in force are carried out to capture
an important position, or there may be a
series of such objectives along a front in a
general offensive. On the other hand, the
object of the defense is not only to repulse the
enemy but also to inflict upon him as great a
loss as possible.</p>

<p class='c008'>The phases of a great attack are: the preparation,
of which the final and most important
element is the bombardment; the assault
of the first line; and the exploitation of success
by fighting in the interior of the position.
The defending troops must combat each one
of these phases by the most adequate measures.
We shall take up these measures in
detail.</p>

<div class="section"></div>
<h3 class='c013'>I. During the Preparation of the Hostile Attack</h3>

<p class='c014'><b>Revealing Symptoms of the Attack.</b> The
preparation of the hostile attack reveals itself
by different preparations:</p>

<p class='c008'>(1) The activity of the enemy:</p>

<p class='c008'>His infantry will send out more numerous
and aggressive patrols and reconnaissance
parties.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_130'>130</span>His artillery will increase its daily destructive
fire.</p>

<p class='c008'>It will multiply its number of registering
shots, establish barrage fires in the interior
of your position, and begin to concentrate
on communication routes.</p>

<p class='c008'>His air service will take on unusual
activities.</p>

<p class='c008'>(2) Vigilant observation of roads and territory
behind the enemy’s lines may reveal
convoys carrying troops and supplies, the assembling
of troops in woods, etc. (smoke from
their kitchens), accumulation of materials
in depots (often accompanied by explosions
in artillery dumps).</p>

<p class='c008'>(3) The observation service may discover
new hostile works, such as the contraction of
parallels of departure out in front of his first
line. There may be also successive parallels
behind the nearest jumping-off trench.</p>

<p class='c008'>(4) Prisoners and deserters, who become
more numerous because of the approaching
offensive, may give valuable information
concerning the coming attack.</p>

<p class='c008'>The task of discovering the enemy’s preparation
for an attack is incumbent upon all
ranks, but above all, this duty devolves particularly
upon the information service, balloon
and air service, and artillery observers.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_131'>131</span>In the sector, the intelligence officer must
perfect his system of observation to the highest
degree. The information in the daily
reports is carefully sorted and tested.</p>

<p class='c008'><b>Preventive Measures before the Attack.</b>
During this time, each chief of area takes
all preventive measures possible against the
coming attack. The attack is an expected
event for which all must be prepared. The
preparation simply consists in perfecting and
carrying out of the original plan of defense.</p>

<p class='c008'><b>Perfecting the Organization of the Position.</b>
New lines are created. The number of continuous
lines between strong points and successive
lines for defense in depth are increased.</p>

<p class='c008'>Old lines, which are enfiladed by the enemy
or which do not give flanking fire, are rectified
or abandoned for new ones. The number of
boyaux and communicating ditches are multiplied
to facilitate the bringing up of reinforcements.</p>

<p class='c008'>New accessories of defense are constructed
and the old ones strengthened. This is
especially done in the interior of the position
with respect to parallel and perpendicular
barbed wire belts to divide the position into
compartments capable of all-round defense.</p>

<p class='c008'>Additional false works are created, to waste
the enemy’s artillery fire, The art of camouflage
<span class='pageno' id='Page_132'>132</span>is extensively used during this phase.
New shelter accommodations and dugouts are
constructed for the better protection of the
garrison during the preliminary bombardment.</p>

<p class='c008'><b>Increase of the Control and Discipline of the
Defense.</b> The guard and observation services
are reinforced. Sentinels, observers,
and patrols are held to a stricter account of
their duties.</p>

<p class='c008'>Machine gun leaders are particular to perfect
the disposition of their guns in depth of
the position for interior fighting. The sector
for each gun emplacement is carefully verified.
Dugouts serving as shelters for guns during
the bombardment are strengthened.</p>

<p class='c008'>The support artillery must constantly
verify the settings of their barrages. Numerous
exercises are carried out for the call of the
barrage with rockets, so as to keep the artillery
constantly on the alert.</p>

<p class='c008'>Liaison must be assured by other means
than the telephone as this latter system usually
breaks down under severe and continuous
shelling. When the telephone is out of order,
chains of runners must be resorted to. In
the ordinary life of the trenches runners are
not used. For this reason, when an attack
is expected, new chains of runners must be
established.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id002'>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_133'>133</span>
<img src='images/i_b_133.jpg' alt='_Type of Shelter off Cover Trench_' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_134'>134</span>Supplies in the depots must be kept up to
contemplated requirements. Besides the regular
depots of the sector, numerous small
ones are now established for the better distribution
of extra ammunition and for the
supply of reinforcing and counterattack
troops. Supply parties are detailed to carry
up ammunition during the battle.</p>

<p class='c008'><b>Moral Preparation of the Troops.</b> When
an attack is expected, this fact must be told the
garrison of each area, so that it can better prepare
for it. The troops must not be left in
ignorance, and upon the officers informing
them devolves the responsibility of performing
this task in such a manner as to raise the
morale of their troops. The men must be
maintained in the best of physical condition.
Their food supply must be regular, of good
quality, and sufficient. The tour of duty of
the interior relief of the first line is shortened.</p>

<p class='c008'><b>Duties during the Preliminary Bombardment.</b>
The most important and final act in
preparation for the attack is a heavy and unusual
bombardment of the position. Concentrated
fire is brought to bear upon all visible
points of the sector to demolish trenches,
emplacements, dugouts, routes, and ammunition
dumps, and to destroy the barbed wire
entanglements. Certain batteries are detailed
for counter-battery work. Barrages
are established to prevent reinforcements
from coming up and to cut communications
with the rear. Against this bombardment,
the defense has both a passive and an active
rôle to play.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id002'>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_135'>135</span>
<img src='images/i_b_135.jpg' alt='_Deep Dug-out, 2nd Line_' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_136'>136</span><b>Maintenance of the Garrison during the
Bombardment.</b> The violence of preliminary
bombardments is ever increasing and there
seems to be no limit. High explosive shells
of every caliber are used against the position.
Any element of your system that is not properly
concealed and can be located by the
enemy is subjected to concentrated artillery
fire until it is blown out of existence. Casualties
inflicted upon the garrison are severe—in
fact, it would seem from the violence of the
artillery fire that few of the garrison could
escape. However, when the assault develops,
a machine gun may be found intact here and
there in the position. One or two of these
powerful weapons, by the use of flanking fire,
may be enough to cause the failure of the
enemy’s attack. It is possible to say that
upon the use of M. G.’s depends the whole
interior defense of the sector.</p>

<p class='c008'>The maintenance of the garrison during the
bombardment depends, of course, upon the
number and depth of dugouts. The service
<span class='pageno' id='Page_137'>137</span>of defense, however, requires many of the
troops to execute their duties in the open
trenches. The leaders must set the example
in this respect by making their rounds, and
taking their posts to observe the area from
the observation posts. In other words, they
must not stay in their dugouts.</p>

<p class='c008'>The bombardment naturally causes a great
deal of repair work to be done. This is executed
at night or during lulls in the shelling.
Only emergency works, however, are executed,
such as repairing of accessory defenses, cleaning
of trenches and rebuilding of shelters.
When this work becomes too heavy for the
garrison, reserve troops are brought up to
assist.</p>

<p class='c008'><b>Reply with Artillery Fire.</b> The only means
to decrease the effectiveness of the hostile
bombardment is to reply with your own artillery.
For this purpose, a certain part of your
artillery is detailed for counter-battery work.
The emplacements or approximate locations
of the hostile guns are set down on maps.
These are divided amongst the counter-battery
artillery who attempt to silence or neutralize
the same.</p>

<p class='c008'>In a sector, the commander may ask for
what is known as counter-preparation fire.
This fire is similar to the preliminary bombardment
<span class='pageno' id='Page_138'>138</span>of the enemy. It covers the entire position
of the enemy and is just as methodical in
its scope. All the artillery that is at the disposal
of the general is used for this purpose,
and consequently the call for this fire must be
through the general.</p>

<p class='c008'>Similar to the counter-preparation fire,
but on a smaller scale, is what is known as
preventive fire which may be called for from
the support artillery. This fire covers the first
and second lines and is used to prevent the
enemy from assembling his troops in the first
line for the assault. This fire has been found
very efficient. It is called for by telephone
and not automatically by rocket.</p>

<div class="section"></div>
<h3 class='c013'>II. Defense of the First Line during a Hostile Attack</h3>

<p class='c014'><b>Duties of Watchers.</b> At the moment the
assault is launched, part of the enemy’s artillery
establishes a barrage on your first line.
The rest of the artillery, however, continues
the regular bombardment to deceive the defenders
as to the exact time of launching the
attack. Therefore, the exact moment that
the enemy comes over the top can only be
determined by the watchers in your first line.
It is their duty to give the alarm so that the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_139'>139</span>garrison can reach its place in the firing line
before the enemy reaches the same. This is
a matter of seconds and not of minutes.
Consequently, each dugout has a watcher
located at its entrance and machine gun dugouts
maintain special watchers. For each
watcher at an entrance there is a second
watcher within sight and calling distance
ready to receive the alarm from the firing
trench. If the second watcher is killed, the
watcher at the entrance moves up and takes
his place while another man from the dugout
goes on watch there. These men are on duty
only from fifteen to thirty minutes at a time.
By a system of relief each occupant of a dugout
serves a tour of duty as a watcher. The
post of the watcher is protected as far as
possible.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id001'>
<img src='images/i_b_139.jpg' alt='POSITION OF WATCHERS' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_140'>140</span><b>The Officer and N. C. O. of the Watch.</b>
During this time, the officer and the N. C.
O. of the watch constantly make their rounds
to see if the watchers are performing their
duty efficiently. Instantly the alarm is
given, the first duty of the officer of the watch
is to set off the rockets calling for the barrage.
At the same time, the orderly that accompanies
him runs to the command post of the
captain where the barrage call is confirmed by
telephone and by rocket. Rocket signals are
repeated and relayed from the same area
until the barrage is obtained.</p>

<p class='c008'><b>Defenders of the First Line.</b> Immediately
the call to arms is given, the troops of
the first line spring out of their shelters and
take their places at the parapet of the firing
trench. If these parapets and fire trenches
have been destroyed, the troops are not in
immediate grave danger, because at this moment
the enemy’s barrage on your first line
has lifted and is progressing toward the second
line. Besides this, the assaulting troops can
not subject the defenders to fire during the
advance. Also, the assaulting column is subjected
to the defensive barrage and is more
<span class='pageno' id='Page_141'>141</span>or less in confusion, due to this fire and having
to cross the shell-torn area of “No Man’s
Land.” Then, too, what is left of your
barbed wire entanglements will hold up the
enemy’s troops. In short, the advantage at
this particular point lies entirely with the
defenders if they can occupy the first line in
time.</p>

<p class='c008'>Among all the weapons of defense, the most
powerful is the machine gun. The successful
repulse of the hostile attack depends to the
greatest extent upon the ability to use machine
guns after the attack is under way. The opportune
fire of one machine gun on the flank
of an assaulting column may disorganize it
and drive back its troops.</p>

<p class='c008'><b>The Captain.</b> As soon as the alarm is given
or it is known that the enemy’s attack has
started, the captain throws his reinforcing
platoons into the first line. These troops, in
going forward, employ the boyaux laid down
in the plan of defense. The hand grenades
that they carry are stored in their dugouts.
The chiefs of the reinforcing platoons do not
necessarily wait for this order of the captain,
but act upon their own initiative in sending
forward their units. If, however, the first
line has already been taken, the reinforcing
platoons automatically carry out the functions
<span class='pageno' id='Page_142'>142</span>of a counterattack by leaving their boyaux
and going over the top to retake the captured
trench. This last movement of over the top
by the counterattacking troops is facilitated
by the fact that the hostile artillery barrage
has by this time passed to the rear of the first
line.</p>

<p class='c008'>The next duty of the captain is to report to
his chief of battalion the alarm, which is done
by means of a chain of runners, by signaling,
or by use of carrier pigeons, because usually
by this time the telephone system has broken
down under the artillery bombardment.</p>

<div class="section"></div>
<h3 class='c013'>III. Fighting in the Interior of the Position</h3>

<p class='c014'>If the hostile assault on the first line is successful,
the fight for the occupation of the
position, which takes place in the interior, has
only begun. Opposing his frontal progression
through the position, the enemy will encounter,
as we know, a series of defensive lines disposed
in depth. Also, for instance, if a nest of resistance
holds up the progress of a part of the
assaulting troops, the successive overlapping
waves will carry on along the flanks of this
stronghold. If, then, the position is strongly
divided into compartments, the fire of such
<span class='pageno' id='Page_143'>143</span>defenses will take these overlapping troops
in the flank and rout them. The defenders
may also play an active rôle and the enemy
is likely to encounter new troops sent up for
the purpose of counterattack.</p>

<p class='c008'>The division of the ground in support points,
centers of resistance and sectors, has precisely
for its object the localization of the enemy’s
attacks. Each area must be organized to
defend itself, independently of any other part
of the position. Consequently, the officers
must explain this condition to their men, so
that they will have no concern if they see
that the enemy has penetrated and is attacking
them on the flank or rear. On the other
hand, if several of these compartments hold
their ground, the enemy may find himself
surrounded in a certain area and cut off from
the rear by barrage fire. Thus abandoned in
a part of the position that he has momentarily
taken, a vigorous counterattack will drive him
out.</p>

<p class='c008'><b>Defense of an Area.</b> The defense of each
area is made similarly to that of the first
line, as these areas embrace the successive
lines of the position. The areas range in
importance from front to rear, the support
point embracing the first line, the center of
resistance the first two lines, and the sector
<span class='pageno' id='Page_144'>144</span>all three lines of the position. The alarm of
an attack is relayed by the area commanders,
the captain to the battalion commander, who
in turn communicates it to the colonel of the
sector. Not only the attacked portion of
the sector is affected by this alarm, but the
whole sector, so to speak, takes up arms.
Let us see what happens as a result of this.</p>

<p class='c008'>All defenders of the area who have a special
duty, immediately occupy their posts and
remain there awaiting developments of the
attack. For example, telephone men will
remain at their instruments, runners will
repair to their relay posts, observers occupy
their observatories, and chiefs and headquarters
officers remain at their command posts.
And above all, the machine gun crews will
man the guns disposed for interior fighting.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id001'>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_145'>145</span>
<img src='images/i_b_145.jpg' alt='FUNCTION OF COUNTER ATTACKS IN INTERIOR OF THE POSITION' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c008'>At the same time, the different troops held
in reserve in the successive lines are used to
hold their own line, to reinforce the line in
front, or to make counterattacks. When the
alarm is given, all supporting reserve troops
take their places in their own lines. In each
support point, the platoons held in reserve are
sent forward as reinforcements to, or to make
counterattacks against, the firing line. Similarly,
in each center of resistance the
companies held in reserve are employed as reinforcements
<span class='pageno' id='Page_146'>146</span>or to recapture the first line. If,
upon arriving at the first line, these troops
receive no orders for particular duty, they replace
the reserve platoons of the support point.
Likewise, the sector reserve of the third line is
sent forward to or, in case the enemy has taken
it, against the second line. The static or passive
organization of the defense lies in the
series of lines of trenches disposed in depth, but
the active rôle of the defender is carried out
in these successive waves of defense moving
forward in definite limits to meet the attack,
not only to repulse it but to inflict as much
loss as possible to the enemy. This transforms
the defensive combat into more nearly
a fight in the open ground, with the spirit of
the offensive.</p>

<p class='c008'><b>The Counterattack.</b> It follows that the
last and, very often, the most decisive means
of defense of the sector is the counterattack.
In each center of resistance, a counterattack
has for its purpose the retaking of the first
line when this is captured by the enemy. It
is made by the battalion reserves located in
the reserve line.</p>

<p class='c008'>The sooner the counterattack is made after
its necessity, the more effective it will be.
It should arrive at the first line almost, one
might say, at the same time that the enemy
<span class='pageno' id='Page_147'>147</span>does. At any rate, the counterattack should
strike the enemy by surprise while he is still
in a state of disorganization. Consequently,
in the plan of defense of the battalion, the
counterattack must be foreseen and all its
details must be laid down. All these details
must be known and practiced by the troops
who are to execute the counterattack, so
that when the alarm is given the counterattack
will start automatically without orders
and be carried to a finish like a good piece of
team-work.</p>

<p class='c008'>The counterattack is launched on the initiative
of the leader of these troops, without
waiting for the orders of the battalion commander.
The latter may not know the exact
situation nor be so located in the area as to appreciate
the opportunity of the counterattack.</p>

<p class='c008'><b>Troops Detailed for the Counterattack.</b>
The company, or companies, held as reserve
of the center of resistance, are divided into
half-companies or platoons under the command
of a single leader. Each one of these
detachments is assigned to a support point and
is put at the disposal of the captain commanding
the same, to counterattack on his first
line if captured by the enemy. In order to
secure the proper liaison between these two
units, the counterattack troops send a messenger
<span class='pageno' id='Page_148'>148</span>to the command post of the support
point which they are assigned to. When
the hostile attack is executed and counterattack
troops are needed, the captain sends
this messenger back to call them up.</p>

<p class='c008'><b>Routes or Directions for Counterattacks.</b>
Each detachment of counterattack troops has
a fixed route for its attack laid down in the
plan of defense. Usually a boyau that it
employs or along which it travels, fixes the
direction. For this reason, in the interior
of the position gaps are left in the barbed
wire entanglements to permit the passage of
these troops in the counterattack. Portable
chevaux-de-frise are employed to fill up these
gaps when necessary.</p>

<p class='c008'><b>Form of the Counterattack.</b> The counterattack
may be executed as a frontal or a flank
attack. Frontal counterattacks are, perhaps,
not as effective as the latter, but they
are more easily executed, especially in the
case where exact knowledge of the situation in
the line in front is not known. This is the
form of advance employed in the support
point where the reinforcing platoons, starting
forward to strengthen the line and finding it
captured, change their tactics by leaping over
the top and charging the line with grenades
and bayonets.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id001'>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_149'>149</span>
<img src='images/i_b_149.jpg' alt='EXAMPLE OF A COUNTER ATTACK EXECUTED BY TWO PLATOONS OF CENTER OF RESISTANCE SUPPORT' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_150'>150</span>A counterattack to the flank usually involves
a little maneuvering. The most successful
of these attacks are those executed in two
detachments—for example, a party of grenadiers
may attack the enemy occupying a part
of the area either on one or both flanks. Its
approach is usually through a trench or boyau.
A second party of riflemen, at the same time,
will make a frontal attack on the enemy over
the top with bayonets. To completely surround
the enemy, an artillery barrage is sometimes
established to cut him off from the rear.</p>

<p class='c008'>The battalion commander works out the
plan of counterattack down to the most
minute detail. But when the hostile attack
is carried out, he is no longer the master of it.
All the foreseen movements start at the proper
time and are carried out in their workings
like a piece of mechanism. The time of the
start of the counterattack is in reality given
by the enemy himself.</p>

<p class='c008'><b>Repair of the Position.</b> After a hostile
attack has been repulsed, the chief of area
must realize that similar attempts may be
made without delay. The first and most
important repair work that must be done is
to construct a parapet along the firing line.
There may be no trench left along this line,
but a fire parapet of sandbags must be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_151'>151</span>constructed immediately. At night reserve
troops are brought up with tools and sandbags
to put the line in the best state of defense
possible.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_152'>152</span>
  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER VI<br /> ATTACK OF A POSITION</h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'><b>Phases of the Attack.</b> As we have already
learned, the attack of a position by a unit
comprises three phases:</p>

<p class='c008'>The preparation of the attack.</p>

<p class='c008'>The assault against the first hostile line.</p>

<p class='c008'>The exploitation of the success by fighting in
the interior of the position for its occupation.</p>

<p class='c008'>These phases are the same as those in open ground
warfare, but their importance, aspect,
and order are not the same. Especially the
preparation of a trench attack is such a preponderant
phase of the attack that upon the
manner of its execution depends the success
of the attack. The exploitation of the success
is a long and decisive operation. In trench
warfare, the assault is only the beginning
of the fighting for a position, and its purpose
is to make a breach in the enemy’s first line.
Through this breach, the reinforcing and reserve
troops are pushed in behind the assaulting
columns to deliver the real combat for the
capture and occupation of the position.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_153'>153</span>Thus we see that the assault, which in open ground
warfare is the final phase of the battle,
is, on the contrary, in trench warfare the first
move of the fight. In open warfare, the order
of the battle is: the preparation, the approach
march and infantry combat, and finally, the
assault. An offensive in trench fighting consists
of, first, the preparation; next, the assault
against the first line; and last of all, the interior
fighting for the position.</p>

<p class='c008'>The cause of this reversion of the rôles of
the attacking troops in a trench offensive
operation lies in the strength and stability of
the fortified front. It is impossible to maneuver
against a continuous line which extends
without a single breach. It is only possible to
maneuver behind the first line or within the
position after a breach has been made. If
a part of the first line gives way before the
pressure of the assailants, the leader of the
attacking units pushes forward his troops
through this breach without consideration of
the strategical value of the part of the line
broken.</p>

<div class="section"></div>
<h3 class='c013'>I. Preparation of the Attack</h3>

<p class='c014'><b>Front of Attack.</b> The tactical unit for an
attack is a division. A division that is placed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_154'>154</span>in the front line for this purpose is called an
attacking division. To such a division is
assigned the task of attacking and capturing
a definite length of front of the hostile position.
All the necessary means to carry out
this mission are in the hands of the division
commander.</p>

<p class='c008'>The tactical unit for an <i>assault</i>, in this
division, is the battalion. Each assaulting
battalion is placed in front of that part of the
hostile line against which it is to operate,
which is called its front of attack. The
length of this front is variable with the tactical
situation. Also, this length in no way
indicates to the enemy the strength of the
attacking troops because they are disposed for
the attack in depth. According to the size
of the front of attack, the battalion commander
will place two or three companies in
the assaulting column, and two or one company
as reinforcing support.</p>

<p class='c008'><b>Conditions of the Assault.</b> An assaulting
battalion must be disposed in a certain manner,
which is called the assaulting disposition.
In establishing this disposition, we must consider
the distance of the assault and the outline
of the assaulting lines.</p>

<p class='c008'><b>Distance of the Assault.</b> The distance
over which the troops make their assault
<span class='pageno' id='Page_155'>155</span>across “No Man’s Land” must not be too
great. This is to avoid as much as possible
the enemy’s barrage and machine gun fire.
For this reason, parallels of departure or
jumping-off trenches, if necessary, may be
constructed out in front of the first line for
the assembling of the assaulting troops. On
the other hand, your own first line should not
be so near to the enemy’s position as to be
in the zone of artillery dispersion when your
own batteries are firing at the enemy’s first
line. However, one is not always master of
this distance, as it is a result of long fighting
and occupation of the two positions. The
proper concealment of these attack works,
such as the parallels of departure, is an essential
condition of success.</p>

<p class='c008'><b>The Trace of the Lines of Departure.</b>
The trace of the lines of departure must be
parallel to the first line of the enemy, not to
your own, so that the assaulting troops will
simply have to start in a perpendicular direction
from the lines of departure to reach their
objective. In other words, the assault is a
simple frontal attack without maneuvers.</p>

<p class='c008'><b>Ground Preparation for the Assault.</b> It
follows from the statements of the conditions
of the assault and also of the tactical and
material preparation of the attack, that the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_156'>156</span>terrain from which these troops will start
must be specially organized for this purpose.
We have discussed the principles and details
of the organization of the position for the
defense, and it is clear that these must differ
materially from those for the attack. An
attack, like a defense, is made with the units
disposed in depth. To launch an attack,
certain of the defensive works that play but a
passive rôle in the resistance, such as barbed
wire entanglements, must be rearranged,
modified, or partially eliminated. Other elements,
such as routes, boyaux, and supply
depots that facilitate the forward movement
of reinforcements, are multiplied.</p>

<p class='c008'><b>Details of the Preparation of the Ground
for the Attack.</b> All the details of the preparation
of the ground for the attack are laid down
in an order called the “Plan of Ground Disposition”
issued by the general of the attacking
division. This order is divided into two
parts: the organization of the works, and their
execution.</p>

<p class='c008'><b>Organization.</b> We know that the disposition
of an assaulting unit is in the form of successive
echelons, called waves. In order to
protect these waves before the assault, it is
necessary to construct for them trenches parallel
to the enemy’s first line; and for this reason
<span class='pageno' id='Page_157'>157</span>these are called parallels of departure. The
trace of the first parallel fixes the directions of
the others behind. For example, an assaulting
battalion which is going to advance in
four waves, might have two parallels of departure
with two waves in each parallel.
These parallels are narrow trenches like the
defensive lines, but with a series of steps in the
front side so that the men can go over the top
easily. If there are no steps, trench ladders
or footholds must be used.</p>

<p class='c008'>Theoretically, one might think that the
distance between these successive parallels
should be the same as that between the attacking
lines. But this is not practicable. Such
practice would mark out boldly on the ground,
for the enemy’s air observation, your intentions
and your dispositions for the attack. Therefore,
this method is strictly prohibited. Besides,
it is not necessary, since the regulation
distances between the lines and waves are not
realized from the point of departure of the
assault. The object of the assaulting companies
is to cross “No Man’s Land” as quickly
as possible to avoid the enemy’s defensive
barrage and machine gun fire. Consequently,
when the different lines of the first wave jump
out of the same parallel of departure, they
will dash across to the enemy’s first line with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_158'>158</span>little regard to distances but with a fixed
idea of reaching their first objective before
the hostile garrison, and before the enemy’s
barrage intervenes. They attain their regulation
distance as soon as the zone of barrage is
passed and when they have arrived at and
crossed the first hostile line.</p>

<p class='c008'>In order not to print the attack on the
ground, so to speak, these different parallels
of departure are not constructed in front of
your position unless absolutely necessary.
They are constructed when the distance
across “No Man’s Land” is more than
five hundred yards, when there is natural
cover, such as woods to conceal them, and
sometimes on reverse slopes. The different
defensive lines of the sector make very convenient
parallels of departure. The first waves
of the assaulting company are placed in the
firing and cover trenches of the first line. The
reinforcing platoons are disposed in the transversal
and intermediate and support lines.
Behind these lines are constructed <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">places
d’armes</span></i> or assembling places for the reserve
troops. These <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">places d’armes</span></i> consist of a
series of short transversal trenches leading off
both sides of a central boyau.</p>

<p class='c008'>If the first hostile line is too far from our
own first line, on the night previous to the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_159'>159</span>attack, hasty parallels of departure are constructed
out in “No Man’s Land” for the
leading wave of the assault. This is to give
this leading element the best possible chance
to arrive at the enemy’s first line uninterrupted
by artillery fire and before the hostile garrison.</p>

<p class='c008'>The work of preparing the ground for the
disposition of the attacking troops also comprehends
the following:</p>

<p class='c008'>Several boyaux.</p>

<p class='c008'>Command posts and observatories in advance
of those of the defensive sector. Each
chief must now be in the middle of his unit
and not behind it.</p>

<p class='c008'>Depots and medical aid stations. Each
company has its own little ammunition depot
near the post of the captain.</p>

<p class='c008'>Ditches for telephone wires. Each battalion
has telephone wires brought up in its
main boyau as far as the first parallel. At
this point, telephone material is stored so that
the system can be carried into the enemy’s
position with the least delay.</p>

<p class='c008'>Small bridges are constructed for the passage
of the parallels by the reserves.</p>

<p class='c008'>It is not necessary that the shelter accommodations
be numerous, especially in the
first line, because the assaulting troops are
brought in only a few days before the attack.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_160'>160</span><b>The Execution of the Works.</b> The second
part of the plan of ground disposition contains
the details of the execution of the works for
the preparation of the ground previous to the
attack. This part consists of;</p>

<p class='c008'>1. Emergency works (necessary to the
assault).</p>

<p class='c023'>Observatories and command posts.</p>

<p class='c023'>The first two parallels of departure for
each battalion. If none need be constructed,
the defensive lines used for this purpose are
designated.</p>

<p class='c023'>Secondary boyaux between parallels, one
for each company.</p>

<p class='c023'>Entrance and evacuation boyaux.</p>

<p class='c023'>Ammunition depots and water points.</p>

<p class='c023'>Dressing stations.</p>

<p class='c023'>If there is more time, the following are
constructed:</p>

<p class='c023'>The third and fourth parallels.</p>

<p class='c023'>Telephone wires and material brought up.</p>

<p class='c023'>Bridges for crossing the parallels.</p>

<p class='c008'>2. Time of duration of the execution of
the works.</p>

<p class='c023'>This may vary from three to twelve
days, or even more, depending upon circumstances.</p>

<p class='c008'>3. Division of labor.</p>

<p class='c023'>This depends upon the number of special
<span class='pageno' id='Page_161'>161</span>working parties at your disposal. A whole
division may be assigned for this work, but
it is not the division that will make the
attack.</p>

<p class='c008'>4. Tools.</p>

<p class='c023'>The tools required for this work are requisitioned
from the headquarters of the
attacking army.</p>

<p class='c008'>5. Ammunition depots.</p>

<p class='c023'>Cartridges, hand grenades, and signal
rockets.</p>

<p class='c008'>6. Ammunition depots.</p>

<p class='c023'>Sandbags and logs.</p>

<p class='c008'>7. Transportation of supplies.</p>

<p class='c023'>Special means of transportation besides
the usual ones, railroads, motor trucks,
mules, horses, etc.</p>

<h4 class='c016'>Artillery Preparation</h4>

<p class='c014'>During the time employed in preparing the
ground for the attack, the artillery executes
the preliminary bombardment. This comprehends
three kinds of fire.</p>

<p class='c008'>1. <b>Counter-Battery Fire.</b> A certain part
of the artillery is detailed to destroy the
hostile batteries or, if this is not possible,
to neutralize them. This result is obtained
by methodical fire on precise targets. Each
<span class='pageno' id='Page_162'>162</span>battery or group of batteries is assigned
certain emplacements to destroy. Counter-battery
fire is long-winded work and is begun
several days or even weeks before the attack.
If the hostile batteries are not destroyed
before the time of attack, they must be neutralized
at this moment by violent shelling
by all the batteries disposed for this purpose,
with shrapnel and other special shells. This
counter-battery action will hinder the hostile
artillery from executing defensive fire, barrage,
preventive fire, counter-preparation fire. It
is carried out by special groups of heavy and
light artillery under control of the general.</p>

<p class='c008'>2. <b>Fire on Communication Routes, Depots,
etc.</b> This fire, besides its destructive
effect upon the enemy’s position, hinders
the arrival of reinforcing troops, material,
ammunition, and food. The shelling of distant
roads, depots, and bivouacs is carried out
by batteries of long-range guns. The fire on
the nearest communications, such as interior
supply routes, entrances of boyaux, kitchen
emplacements, etc., is executed by light batteries
of the divisional artillery.</p>

<p class='c008'>3. <b>Destructive Fire.</b> Before the attack,
the whole of the enemy’s position is submitted
to methodical and violent artillery fire for
the purpose of destroying:</p>

<p class='c023'><span class='pageno' id='Page_163'>163</span>Obstacles which may hinder the advance
of the assaulting column: accessory defenses,
such as barbed wire entanglements.</p>

<p class='c023'>Elements of the defense, such as strong
points, machine gun emplacements, observatories,
depots, shelters, and dugouts.</p>

<p class='c008'>Each different kind of target calls for a certain
number of rounds of a particular caliber.
These calculations of the different numbers of
rounds are the results of experience and are
set down in tables for the information of the
sector commander. The time, therefore,
necessary for a proper preparation for the
attack is a function of the number and
strength of targets. The artillery preparation
may last from one to twenty days, but it
must continue until the elements of the hostile
position are sufficiently destroyed to assure
a successful attack.</p>

<p class='c008'>Before an offensive, there is placed at the disposal
of the attacking divisions, besides their
regular divisional artillery, a special allotment
of batteries. The different calibers of guns
are used according to the nature of the
target. The largest calibers are employed
against the strongest elements of the organization:
nests of resistance, strong points, and
deep dugouts. Light artillery is used to obliterate
trenches and boyaux and interior barbed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_164'>164</span>wire entanglements. Trench mortars serve
to destroy the elements of the first line and
its accessory defenses.</p>

<p class='c008'><b>Plan of Artillery Action.</b> The details for
the execution of these different artillery fires
are laid down in the plan of action of the
artillery of the army corps or of the division.
This plan is a part of the plan of battle of the
division. These details must be carried out
punctually and with precision. The sector
commanders are not interested directly in the
execution of these fires, but they are in their
results.</p>

<p class='c008'><b>Duties of the Infantry during the Artillery
Preparation.</b> In connection with the artillery
fire, the infantry in the position must
observe the results of the bombardment and
the leaders report their opinion upon its
control.</p>

<p class='c008'><b>Observation.</b> The observation of the
counter-battery fire, long-range fire on communication
routes, and destructive fire on the
interior of the position, falls upon the artillery’s
ground observers and the aviation service.
But the duty of observing the results of
destructive fire on the enemy’s first line is
carried out with the help of the infantry
observers. Each regiment must observe the
front upon which it is to make the attack.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_165'>165</span>Special attention is paid to the destruction
of barbed wire entanglements and machine
gun emplacements. The interested infantry
does not content itself with a passive observation,
but must send out at night, or even in
daylight, offensive reconnaissance parties.
Their mission is to actually go into the enemy’s
first line, to ascertain its condition, and to
investigate the breaches in the hostile entanglements.
The tactics of such a reconnaissance
are the same as for a raid. The
information gathered is sent to the division
headquarters in the daily report of the intelligence
officer or in special information
reports.</p>

<p class='c008'><b>Control.</b> It is both the privilege and the
duty of the infantry commanders to state in
their daily reports their opinion on the artillery
preparation. If they do not express their
exact opinion on the progress of the bombardment,
they are liable to pay for their carelessness
at the time of the assault.</p>

<p class='c008'><b>Destruction of the Enemy’s Position.</b>
The experiences of three years of trench warfare
have given bitter proof that an attack
against an insufficiently destroyed position
will not only fail but will result in great losses.
It is sheer folly to attempt an assault against
undestroyed entanglements, or against a line
<span class='pageno' id='Page_166'>166</span>in which the machine gun posts have not been
demolished. One does not oppose materiel
with men. In trench warfare, the conquest
of the ground is made by the artillery; the
infantry follow up this conquest to occupy and
to hold the ground. The essential condition
for the success of an attack depends upon the
proper destruction of the elements of a position
by the artillery.</p>

<p class='c008'><b>Plan of Battle.</b> The plan of battle depends
upon, first, the strength of the enemy, obstacles
to the attacking troops, lines of defense,
nests of resistances, barbed wire, etc.;
and secondly, the mission of the attacking
unit and the means at its disposal.</p>

<p class='c008'><b>Strength of the Enemy.</b> The Information
Service of a division has so many different
methods of obtaining information and data of
the enemy and his defenses that the assaulting
troops can be constantly kept advised of the
state of the hostile position. The regiment
receives daily from the division headquarters
an information bulletin, aëroplane pictures,
and precise maps of the hostile lines. Upon
these data the regimental commander bases his
plan of battle. Comparisons of aëroplane
pictures and maps are particularly useful.
From all these data, the regimental intelligence
officer makes pertinent extracts for the information
of the battalion commander. Copies
of the different maps are distributed by the
battalion and company commanders to their
officers and non-commissioned officers in
order that they may have a better knowledge
of the hostile position for the attack.</p>

<img src='images/i_b_167.jpg' alt='CONVERGENCE ON THE OBJECTIVE FOR THE ATTACK METHOD OF REDUCING A NEST OF RESISTANCE' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_168'>168</span><b>Mission.</b> The general plan of battle is
issued by the division commander. Based
upon the terms of this order, the Colonel,
Battalion Commander, and Captain issue
detailed orders of their own plan of battle.
The plan of battle of a small unit usually
comprehends the following points:</p>

<p class='c023'>Mission of the unit in the attack.</p>

<p class='c023'>Front to be attacked, with definite limits.</p>

<p class='c023'>Objectives, different lines to be taken, the
last objective.</p>

<p class='c023'>Disposition of the unit for the attack; formation,
intervals.</p>

<p class='c023'>Disposition of the unit in the parallels of
departure before the attack.</p>

<p class='c023'>The day (D) and hour (H) of attack.</p>

<p class='c023'>Direction of the attack; compass angle.</p>

<p class='c023'>Position of the leader.</p>

<p class='c023'>Tactical relation with the neighboring
units during the advance.</p>

<p class='c023'>Use of specialists; machine guns, trench
cleaners, etc.</p>

<p class='c023'>Support of artillery during the attack.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_169'>169</span>Unit liaison during the attack:</p>

<p class='c023'>With neighboring units and leaders
(runners, telephone, signaling, carrier
pigeons).</p>

<p class='c023'>With the support artillery (detachment
of liaison, observatories, and rockets).</p>

<p class='c023'>With air service (rockets, signaling,
Bengal fires).</p>

<p class='c023'>With balloon service (searchlights).</p>

<p class='c023'>Equipment for the attack.</p>

<p class='c023'>Supply of ammunition and water; advanced
supply points.</p>

<p class='c008'>Evacuation of the wounded; dressing stations,
routes of evacuation, auto ambulance
points. Also, routes of evacuation for prisoners
and assembling points for same.</p>

<p class='c008'>This plan of battle is so drawn up that it
may be executed any later day that may be
designated in the order for the attack.</p>

<p class='c008'><b>Preparation of the Men for the Attack.</b> The
work of fitting their men physically, professionally,
and morally for the task before them
devolves upon the leaders of all ranks. By
a system of relief, the men of the garrison get
short periods of rest behind the sector to shake
off the atmosphere of the trenches. Continuous
instruction of both men and officers in the
basic principles of fighting should be carried
on at all times. The moral training of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_170'>170</span>men depends to a great extent upon the
officers. The leaders, by example and encouraging
words, should instill into their
soldiers that fighting spirit which makes for
success in battle.</p>

<div class="section"></div>
<h3 class='c013'>II.  The Assault</h3>

<h4 class='c016'>Formations for the Assault</h4>

<p class='c014'><b>Disposition in Depth.</b> The assault has for
its purpose the capture of the first hostile line,
that is to say, the crossing of “No Man’s
Land” and penetrating the enemy’s position.
The assault is only the beginning of the combat.
When the breach has been made in the
enemy’s first line, the assaulting and reinforcing
troops must continue the fighting in the
interior for the conquest of the position. The
direct object of the assault is to open the way
for the attacking troops into the position.
The attacking troops are disposed in depth
in a series of echelons, so that during the
advance each echelon is brought into the
battle at the proper moment. This rule of
formation in depth is followed without exception
by every unit of whatever size.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id001'>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_171'>171</span>
<img src='images/i_b_171.jpg' alt='_A Battalion Attack Formation (Distances in Yds.)_' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_172'>172</span>The regiment forms with one or two assaulting
battalions, and two or one battalion behind
in reserve. The battalion has three or, better,
only two assaulting companies and one or two
companies with machine guns, in the second
echelon as support. The company may have
three, but more usually two, assaulting platoons
with one or more reinforcing platoons
in the second line.</p>

<p class='c008'><b>Waves.</b> The successive echelons have received
the name “waves.” This designation
is expressive but not clear, and causes mistakes.</p>

<p class='c008'>First, waves may be formed by different
dispositions: in deployed line or in line of small
columns.</p>

<p class='c008'>Secondly, the waves are not always composed
of the same strength of troops or units,
and consequently are not of the same disposition.
The battalion commander will
designate his first assaulting company as his
first assaulting wave. Similarly, the company
commander designates his assaulting
platoons as the first wave; and the platoon
leader, his first skirmish line as the first wave
of the platoon.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id002'>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_173'>173</span>
<img src='images/i_b_173.jpg' alt='ATTACKING COMPANY TWO PLATOONS IN THE FIRST LINE' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_174'>174</span>Lastly, the real significance of the term
“wave” lies in its application to the formation
of the departure of the attack and during the
first part of its advance into the interior of the
hostile position. As soon as the assaulting
echelons are held up by nests of resistance,
they are obliged to halt while neighboring
echelons on both flanks continue the advance.
Also, reinforcing units will come up from behind
to outflank such a nest. As soon as such
a condition arises within the enemy’s position,
the disposition of the troops in waves is lost
and the fight is continued in the best formation
possible under the circumstances.</p>

<h4 class='c016'>Formation of an Assaulting Battalion</h4>

<p class='c014'><b>Assaulting Companies.</b> In an assaulting
company, a certain number of platoons are
placed in the first or assaulting line, and the
rest in the second line as reinforcing platoons.</p>

<p class='c008'>The assaulting platoons deploy usually in
two lines of skirmishers, the different specialists
being assigned to places in these lines depending
upon their functions in the attack.
The line of assaulting platoons is known as the
line of combat. A third line of grenadiers
follows closely behind the assaulting platoon,
and may be called a part of it. These grenadiers
are furnished by the reinforcing platoons
and are known as trench cleaners.
Their function does not begin until the hostile
line is reached, and it is to clear out the
trenches of the first line of the enemy while
the assaulting troops continue their advance
in the open ground.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id002'>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_175'>175</span>
<img src='images/i_b_175.jpg' alt='ATTACKING COMPANY THREE PLATOONS IN THE FIRST LINE' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_176'>176</span>The reinforcing platoons are either deployed
in lines of skirmishers or lines of small columns.
These platoons constitute the line of reinforcement
and follow the advance of the assaulting
platoons at a distance of about forty to sixty
yards. The machine guns detailed to the
assaulting companies by the chief of battalion
are placed with the reinforcing platoons and
are usually carried on the flanks.</p>

<p class='c008'>Considering the battalion as the assaulting
unit and adopting the term “wave” to designate
each platoon, we may say that the company
of the first echelon of the assault is disposed
in two waves. The position of the captain is
in front of the second wave between the two
reinforcing platoons. His liaison group remains
with him.</p>

<p class='c008'><b>Supporting Companies.</b> The supporting
companies of an assaulting battalion constitute
the second echelon. These companies,
also, are formed in two waves. These waves
are formed like those of the reinforcing platoons
of the assaulting company, either in
deployed lines or in lines of small columns.
Usually the battalion has two companies in
the first line and two in the second line. In
other words, the battalion carries out the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_177'>177</span>assault in two echelons of two waves each,
the distance between the two echelons being
from 200 to 300 yards.</p>

<p class='c008'>In rear of the support companies and
following their advance, are the remaining
machine guns of the battalion and the 37 mm.
platoon.</p>

<p class='c008'>The position of the battalion commander
with his liaison group is directly in front of
the second echelon and between his support
companies.</p>

<p class='c008'><b>Disposition of Assaulting Battalion in the
Departure Trenches.</b> We have seen that for
an attack the ground is specially organized
for this purpose and the attacking troops are
disposed in <i>successive parallels</i> or <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">places d’armes</span></i>.
Usually this disposition is as follows:</p>

<p class='c008'>The <i>two waves</i> of the assaulting companies
are placed in the first and second parallels
which under ordinary circumstances will be
the fire trench and cover trench of the first
defensive line.  <i>Consequently</i>, the different
lines of each wave will occupy the same parallel,
but at the moment of the assault the successive
departures of the lines will permit them
to automatically gain the necessary distances
to separate them in the advance across “No
Man’s Land.” <i>For example</i>, let us assume
that there are four lines (this is the maximum)
<span class='pageno' id='Page_178'>178</span>placed in one parallel. The men are numbered
from 1 to 4 in successive groups of four each.
Each No. 1 man belongs to the first line;
each No, 2, to the second line, and so on.
The distance between similar numbers in the
parallels is about four paces, giving the proper
skirmish intervals to the line. At the given
signal of the leader of the line, the No. 1’s
go over the top. The No. 2’s follow at the
prescribed distance ordered or at another
signal given by their leader. The other lines
follow similarly, so that the assaulting troops
have the regulation interval in line and a prescribed
(not always regulation) distance in
depth.</p>

<p class='c008'>The two waves of the support companies
are placed in a third parallel or <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">place d’armes</span></i>.
This third parallel is usually an intermediate
trench, or special work, executed for this purpose,
located between the first and second
defensive lines.</p>

<p class='c008'>Machine guns and 37 mm. guns are located
on the ground in relation to their places in the
advance during the attack.</p>

<p class='c008'>The battalions which are kept as reserves
according to the plan of battle of the sector
commander, are disposed in <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">places d’armes</span></i>
organized behind the parallels of departure.
The colonel and his headquarters occupy a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_179'>179</span>command post directly behind the assaulting
battalion from where he can witness the
launching of the assault and the crossing of
“No Man’s Land.”</p>

<p class='c008'><b>Order of the Attack.</b> The attacking troops
take the disposition that has just been explained
some days before the attack. This
disposition is laid down in a paragraph of the
Plan of Battle. Each leader of an attacking
unit, with a map of the ground on which his
area is specially outlined, must study his disposition
on the ground previous to the arrival
of his troops. Besides this, the leaders must
pay special attention to the hostile position,
verifying the direction of the attack, and identifying
the successive objectives and the nests
of resistance that will be encountered.</p>

<p class='c008'>When the general who is in charge of the
attack judges that the artillery preparation
is sufficient, that the supply systems for the
attack are properly organized, that all is
ready and, in short, that the psychological
moment has arrived, he gives his order for the
attack.</p>

<p class='c008'>Based upon the divisional order for the
attack, the colonels, battalion commanders,
and captains issue their own orders. The difference
between the plan of battle and the
order for the attack lies in the fact that the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_180'>180</span>latter fixes all the details of execution of the
general operations laid down in the former.
But also, the order for the attack contemplates
the first measures to be taken as soon as the
assault is carried out, especially the extension
of the liaisons (telephone lines) and communications
(boyaux) from the first parallel of
departure up to the enemy’s position.</p>

<p class='c008'>The order for the attack contains precise
details of the following points:</p>

<p class='c023'>Exact hour of the attack; or signal rocket
for the same.</p>

<p class='c023'>Details of the successive objectives;
different resistances that will probably be
encountered.</p>

<p class='c023'>Time-table of the moving barrage and the
rate of its advance.</p>

<p class='c023'>Prolongation of the telephone lines;
particular wires to be extended.</p>

<p class='c023'>Prolongation of communications; boyaux
to be built at night across “No Man’s
Land”; units detailed for this purpose.</p>

<p class='c023'>Supply of ammunition and water in the
captured position; points of distribution.</p>

<p class='c008'><b>Departure of the Assault</b> [The hour (H)].
We have now arrived at the most important
and critical moment of the battle, the hour (H)
of launching of the assault. A few minutes
before the hour (H) the men take the places
<span class='pageno' id='Page_181'>181</span>assigned them in the parallels with strict
orders to remain there. Bayonets are fixed
on the rifles. Useless movements and noise
of any kind are prohibited. Each man holds
himself in readiness awaiting the signal of his
immediate chief. Each chief of unit himself
ascertains that his men are in readiness and
in good condition for the assault. He sends
all wounded back to shelter. The leader must
impress his men with the confidence that he
knows his duty, that he has foreseen and is
prepared to meet all circumstances of the
coming battle; The value of troops at this
moment depends upon their leaders.</p>

<p class='c008'><b>Support Artillery.</b> During the time just
preceding the hour (H) all the artillery which
does not execute counter-battery fire is employed
to protect the assault. A part of this
artillery is given to each of the assaulting
battalions as support artillery. Liaison and
observation detachments are sent by this
artillery to the infantry battalions to which
they are attached. These detachments have
the same composition and rôle as explained
in the defense of a position.</p>

<p class='c008'>The artillery support holds under its fire
that part of the hostile line assigned to its
infantry battalion. A violent fire is especially
directed against the enemy’s first line,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_182'>182</span>the objective of the assault. Protected by
this fire, the assaulting battalion moves forward.
For a few moments after the launching
of the first waves over the top, this fire
remains on the enemy’s first line. The protective
barrage is then lifted and is established
on the hostile second line, where it also remains
for a certain time, according to the
barrage time-table, and so on.</p>

<p class='c008'><b>Departure of the First Echelon</b> (Assaulting
Companies). At the precise moment or signal
the first wave of an assaulting company
jumps out of its parallel of departure, the different
lines of which it is composed being formed
as previously explained. In a similar manner,
as soon as the first wave is launched, the
second wave goes over the top of its parallel.
All the different lines of the different assaulting
companies advance straight to the front
towards their first objective. The rate of
advance, although not a run, is as rapid as the
circumstances of the torn up ground of “No
Man’s Land” will permit, at the same time
maintenance of the formations being paramount.
Success depends upon the proper
location of the specialists in the formations
of the waves, and this order must not be lost
in the confusion that results from too much
speed.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_183'>183</span>The result is that all the lines of the assaulting
companies start almost at the same time
from the two parallels of departure, and with
shorter distances between the lines than that
called for by regulation. This formation is
not a drawback, but, on the contrary, works
to better advantage. The first and most important
thing to avoid at this time is the defensive
barrage of the watchful enemy. This is
established as soon as he is aware of the
assault. If the reinforcing line follows closely
behind the line of combat, it has a better
chance of passing the danger zone before the
enemy’s barrage is established. A company
caught under the enemy’s barrage will lose,
on an average, fifty per cent. of its effectives.
Also, the assaulting companies must arrive in
the first hostile line as quickly as possible behind
their own barrage. The assaulting platoons,
who set the pace, should arrive there
almost “as soon as the barrage lifts.” Troops
that arrive at this opportune moment will surprise
the enemy in his shelters or in the act of
taking his place on the firing line. It is better
to risk losing a few lives by your own barrage
than to give the enemy time to man his first
line.</p>

<p class='c008'>Finally, the regulation distances between
the different lines and waves will be attained
<span class='pageno' id='Page_184'>184</span>during the progress after passing the enemy’s
first line.</p>

<p class='c008'><b>Departure of the Second Echelon</b> (Supporting
Companies). When the first echelon,
or assaulting companies, have crossed “No
Man’s Land,” the battalion commander
usually launches the second echelon, or supporting
companies. By this time, the battalion
commander will have an impression of
the assault, and the distance which separates
the two echelons is at this moment
the one usually required (200 to 300
yards). In order to avoid the enemy’s barrage
and to profit by any lull in his fire,
the battalion commander chooses the exact
moment for the departure of the second
echelon.</p>

<p class='c008'><b>Advance of the Reserves.</b> As soon as all
the waves of the assaulting battalion have
penetrated the enemy’s position, the reserve
battalions of the regiment leave their <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">places
d’armes</span></i> and move forward through boyaux
to the first parallels of departure. In this
position they await the order of the colonel
to advance into the enemy’s position to join
the combat for its conquest. The colonel
awaits the first report from his assaulting
battalion before giving the order for the
advance of the reserves.</p>

  <div class="section"></div>
<h3 class='c013'>III.  Fighting in the Interior of the</h3>
</div>
<p class='c014'>Position and Exploitation</p>

<p class='c008'><b>Principle of the Fighting.</b> The fundamental
principle of the fighting in the interior
of the position is that each attacking unit from
the division down to the battalion receives a
definite objective. This objective is usually
an area containing the lines of the hostile position
with precise flanking limits. The farthest
line in the objective area must be gained
by the units at all costs. Beyond this last
objective, strong reconnaissance parties and
patrols are sent to keep contact with the
enemy.</p>

<p class='c008'>Usually the attacking regiments, which
carry out the struggle in the interior of the
position, are assigned the mission to capture
the third or covering line of the artillery.
The continuation of the struggle beyond this
line and the capturing of the enemy’s guns
is what is called “the tactical exploitation of
the success.” The troops that carry out this
operation are the reserves of the division held
out for this particular purpose. The plan
of battle does not include orders for this
action.</p>

<p class='c008'><b>Details of the Interior Fighting.</b> Let us
follow an attacking regiment in its progress in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_186'>186</span>the interior of a hostile position, and consider
the use of the different echelons of which it is
composed: assaulting companies, reinforcing
companies, and reserves.</p>

<p class='c008'><b>Assaulting Companies.</b> The advance of
the assaulting platoons regulates the advance
of all the successive elements. These platoons,
after crossing the first hostile line, continue
their movement without hesitation. The
rate of advance is, of course, variable with
the difficulties of the ground and the strength
of the hostile organization. For this reason
it cannot be very rapid. The pace of the
leading elements of the assaulting column is
foreseen in the plan of battle (depends upon
the strength of the enemy’s position), and this
becomes the rate of advance of the moving
barrage. If no unforeseen and serious resistance
is encountered, the assaulting platoons
will be able to keep up with their protective
barrage. Sometimes, however, they may halt
for a moment in their progress under cover of
some shelter to regain their alignment.</p>

<p class='c008'>As a part of the assaulting platoon comes
the trench-cleaner detachment. The trench
cleaners are armed with hand grenades and
trench knives. Their function is to enter the
hostile trenches taken and, profiting by the
surprise effect of the attack, to vanquish
<span class='pageno' id='Page_187'>187</span>the last resistance and to make prisoners of
the defenders still in the dugouts. They pay
special attention to picketing all entrances,
exits, and shafts of dugouts so that detachments
of the enemy cannot come out and fire
into the rear of the waves that have already
crossed. If the different lines of the hostile
platoon are very far apart, the number of
trench cleaners is increased, a detachment
dropping off in each line.</p>

<p class='c008'>As long as the assaulting platoons do not
meet resistance, the reinforcing platoons follow
the former at the regulation distance to
avoid mixing of the different waves of the
attack. If, however, the assaulting platoons
suffer severe losses, and are unable to continue
the progress, the reinforcing platoon, either by
order of the captain or upon the initiative of
its leader, moves up and reinforces the combat
line. Its function then becomes the same
as that of the assaulting platoon.</p>

<p class='c008'>Again, if a gap should occur in the combat
line, due to losses or extension of the front,
the reinforcing platoon moves in that direction
and fills the gap. In general, the tactics
of the reinforcing platoon are always to assure
continuity of progress by outflanking resistances
that have stopped the advance of the
platoon in front.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_188'>188</span>The machine guns attached to an assaulting
unit follow and protect the flanks. When
halted they fire on retreating hostile troops and
on special points of resistance. Their special
use, however, is against counterattacks.</p>

<p class='c008'><b>Reinforcing Companies.</b> The reinforcing
companies, with the machine gun reserve and
37 mm. gun of the assaulting battalion, after
they have penetrated the hostile position,
follow the progress of the assaulting waves
at the prescribed distance. They advance in
line of small columns but make use of any
cover that the ground affords to minimize
losses from hostile fire. During this advance,
their mission is to rally all the elements of the
assaulting companies and push them forward;
and also to watch out for the flanks, pushing
out to protect them on their own initiative if
necessary. But when the line of combat is
held up by resistance the supporting companies
are maneuvered by order of the battalion
commander. Naturally, the whole line of
combat will not progress uniformly. Certain
assaulting platoons will be held up by nests
of resistance, while others in the intervals will
carry on with less interruption. Reinforcing
platoons and support companies are maneuvered
to outflank such nests of resistance and
to fill the resulting gaps in the combat line.</p>

<span class='pageno' id='Page_189'>189</span>
<img src='images/i_b_189.jpg' alt='MANEUVERS AGAINST A NEST OF RESISTANCE' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_190'>190</span>Let us take a concrete example of an assaulting
company followed by a supporting
company held up by a nest of resistance (a
ravine, reverse slope, or woods strongly
organized with machine guns) and follow the
movements of the reinforcing platoons and
supporting company. (Examine the diagram
showing maneuvers against a nest of resistance
in connection with the following explanation.)
The first figure shows the formation of
the four platoons of an assaulting company
advancing in the interior of a position followed
by a supporting company. The 1st
and 2nd are the assaulting platoons, and the
3rd and 4th the reinforcing platoons. The
supporting company follows in double column
of platoons. The second figure shows the
1st assaulting platoon held up by a nest
of resistance with the 3rd or reinforcing platoon
moved up on the right flank. Platoons
<b>2</b> and <b>4</b> of the same company carry on, and
this movement results in a gap in the line of
combat between the 2nd and 3rd platoons.
The third figure shows the 1st and 2nd
platoons of the supporting company moved up
in this gap, and the 3rd and 4th platoons acting
as reserves. The nest of resistance is
thus attacked from the front and flank and
the continuity of the combat line maintained.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_191'>191</span>When a nest of resistance is encountered
the attacking troops must not accumulate in
front, as this will multiply the losses. The
line of combat will attack the front of a nest
of resistance while the successive reinforcing
and supporting waves maneuver against its
flanks. The battalion commander will use all
the weapons at his disposal as machine guns,
37 mm. guns, and rifle grenades to reduce
the nest of resistance. If this method fails
he will have to call on the artillery for help,
but this necessitates a modification of the
artillery barrage time-table.</p>

<p class='c008'><b>Rôle of the Artillery during the Attack.</b>
During the attack the artillery carries out the
following different fires:</p>

<p class='c023'>Counter-battery fire.</p>

<p class='c023'>Protective fire on the flanks of the attack.</p>

<p class='c023'>Accompaniment or barrage fire.</p>

<p class='c008'>The first two fires are executed by a part of
the artillery directly under the chief of artillery
of the division, who in turn is under the
control of the general.</p>

<p class='c008'>The third kind of fire is executed by the
support artillery, detailed to the different
assaulting battalions as in the defensive organization.
The action of this artillery directly
interests each infantry chief of area, to whom
are sent liaison detachments and observers
<span class='pageno' id='Page_192'>192</span>(an officer, N. C. O.’s, and artillery orderlies).
This third kind of fire is the only one that we
will consider in detail.</p>

<p class='c008'><b>Principle of the Accompaniment Fire.</b>
During the progress of the attack the support
artillery establishes a moving barrage in front
of the advancing infantry. This barrage
travels by bounds. It remains for a certain
time on each defensive line and at intervals
between them so as to thoroughly sweep the
intervening ground. The time-table, or rate
of this moving barrage, is laid down in the
plan of action of the artillery. The infantry
leaders of course are acquainted with this time-table.</p>

<p class='c008'><b>Other Means of Controlling the Barrage.</b>
The moving barrage may also be advanced
successively by order of the commanding
general according to information received
from the leading elements of the assaulting
battalion, from the artillery or aëroplane
observers.</p>

<p class='c008'>Calls may be made directly from the line of
combat by rockets, or other means of liaison.
With reference to the barrage there are two
uses of rockets; one is for calling the barrage
in the defensive, and the other is calling for
an advance of the barrage during the attack.
It may be remarked that it is impossible to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_193'>193</span>call for a decrease in range of the barrage as
this, of course, would be dangerous to your own
troops. It is better to decrease the rate of
advance of the barrage rather than to have it
move too quickly and risk abandoning the
infantry.</p>

<p class='c008'>Lastly, the preceding means for controlling
the barrage can be employed in conjunction.
That is to say, a time-table for the barrage is
adhered to during the first part of the advance
when the positions of the hostile lines are well
known, while during the last part, when the
infantry’s progress is not so regular and the
ground is not so well known, each advance of
the barrage may be called for by rocket, as
each resistance met with is disposed of. If
an assaulting battalion meets a resistance
which it cannot reduce by its own means, it
must call upon the support artillery for help.
To do this, the artillery must halt its barrage
and for an interval the time-table is not in
effect. Such an emergency calls for a special
action on the part of the support artillery, and
also for the intervention of any other artillery
at the disposal of the general. This particular
action of the artillery may be called for automatically
by rocket or by the other means of
liaison. The rôle of the officer and N. C. O.
of the artillery liaison detachment is to give
<span class='pageno' id='Page_194'>194</span>the artillery the precise technical information
necessary in such a case to establish its fire
on a nest of resistance. This action of halting
the barrage and giving the artillery a new
objective is exceptional and delicate to execute.
As soon as the resistance is reduced,
the time-table is resumed.</p>

<p class='c008'><b>Liaisons During the Attack.</b> The proper
co-ordination of all the foreseen developments
of the attack lies in a good system of liaison.
There must be leadership liaison for the transmission
of orders and reports, and infantry-artillery
liaison for the proper co-operation of
the two arms. The means of liaison in the
offensive are the same as those considered in
the defensive organization. The principle of
their use is the same but made more difficult
by the progress of the different attacking
echelons. It is the duty of all leaders to foresee
the establishment of liaison for the engagement
in their plan of battle, and also for
the prolongation of these means with the
advance of the attacking troops.</p>

<p class='c008'>The means of liaison are:</p>

<p class='c008'>Telephone lines (for leadership in artillery.
They are lengthened from the parallel of
departure to the interior of the enemy’s
position.)</p>

<p class='c008'>Signal communication (established from
<span class='pageno' id='Page_195'>195</span>the enemy’s position to a central point in
the rear).</p>

<p class='c008'>Rockets (precise signification of each kind
laid down in orders).</p>

<p class='c008'>Carried pigeons (headquarters that are to
carry these laid down in orders).</p>

<p class='c008'>Detachment of special runners (essential to
be established between all units).</p>

<p class='c008'><b>Aviation.</b> During the advance, a particular
system of liaison is established with the air
service. Each division has at its disposal a
certain number of accompanying planes that
fly low and follow the assaulting battalions.
Their duty is to establish communication
between the leading elements of the advancing
infantry, and the artillery, and the commanding
general. The infantry signal to these airplanes
by means of rockets and Bengal fires,
and the planes in turn communicate with the
artillery and the commanding general by
means of wireless.</p>

<p class='c008'>1. In accordance with Field Orders #7,
these headquarters, the attack will be made
at the hour (H).</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>H = 10:30 <span class='fss'>A. M.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>2. The three objectives of the attack are:
<span class='pageno' id='Page_207'>207</span>1st, PLAINE trench; 2nd, ENVER PASHA
trench; 3rd, L’ENCLUME and MARTEAU
trenches.</p>

<p class='c008'>For the capture of these three objectives
the plan of the Bn. commander is as follows:</p>

<p class='c008'>The assaulting Cos., after taking the 1st
and 2nd objectives will proceed to the attack
of the 3rd objective, while the mopping up
parties clean up the captured trenches. As
the assaulting Cos. leave the 2nd objective,
the Bn. commander will give the order for the
supporting Cos. to start, in order that they
will reach the 2nd objective at the same time
the assaulting Cos. reach the 3rd. In case
the assaulting Cos. are compelled to stop before
reaching the 3rd objective, the Bn. commander
will use the supporting Cos. to outflank
the nest of resistance expected to be
encountered in L’ENCLUME wood.</p>

<p class='c008'>3. The moving barrage will halt 10 minutes
immediately in rear of the 2nd objective
and 10 minutes on the 3rd objective. With
the exception of these halts the barrage will
move at a uniform rate of 20 yards per
minute.</p>

<p class='c008'>4. As soon as the Bn. commander reaches
the point 6919 a telephone liaison will be
established from the starting point in the
ANSPACH trench to point 6919.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_208'>208</span>From point 6919 a signal liaison will be
established with the artillery observation post
in the EDMOND BUTTE.</p>

<p class='c008'>5. The supply detachments will carry 400
hand grenades, 50 illuminating and 50 signal
rockets.</p>

<p class='c008'>3. Two parties of grenadiers each will be furnished
from the same Co. to protect the flanks
of the raiding party on each side of the salient.
The raiding party will penetrate the
enemy’s first line by a frontal attack, capture
the defenders of the salient and return directly
by the same route. The raiding party will
crawl into “No Man’s Land” in front of the
PLAINE salient until it reaches the enemy’s
barbed wire and will prepare detonators for
the necessary breaches. The signal to explode
the detonators and rush into the salient
will be given by the leader of the raid by
rocket. The raid will last ten minutes.</p>

<h3 class='c013'>I. Raids</h3>

<p class='c014'>The object of a raid is to attack a special
point in the hostile lines, destroy it, and return
with prisoners or information. Such a point
may be a salient, blockhouse, observation or
listening post, etc. The purpose of the raid
is both to prosecute the attrition of the enemy
and to gather information. A raid is made
with or without a previous artillery preparation.
Usually, however, the barbed wire entanglements
of the enemy are subjected to a
short and intense artillery shelling. Whether
or not an artillery bombardment is carried out,
the tactics of the raid are the same. Success
of a raid depends entirely on its preparation,
which must be thorough and complete
in every detail so that every man in the raid
knows his part.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id001'>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_217'>217</span>
<img src='images/i_b_217.jpg' alt='RAID AGAINST A HOSTILE POINT' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_218'>218</span><b>Preparation.</b> The troops employed for a raid
are a specially chosen unit, a platoon or half-company.
Better still, a regiment may have
a detachment specially trained in this work.
When a raid has been decided upon against a
particular point in the hostile line, the leader
of the raid has the following duties to perform:</p>

<p class='c008'>1. He goes to the command post of the
center of resistance opposite to the point in
the enemy’s line against which the raid is to
be made. Here he gathers all necessary information
concerning the enemy by studying
maps and sketches, and comparing them with
the ground. He also speaks with occupants
of the first line for the purpose of getting information;
and calls upon the commander of
the center of resistance to send special listening
parties, if necessary, to the enemy’s line,
observing necessary precautions to prevent
the enemy from becoming suspicious of a contemplated
raid.</p>

<p class='c008'>From the detailed information, maps and
sketches that the leader of the raid has obtained
from the headquarters of the center of
resistance and from his own reconnaissance,
he lays out a model of the hostile point to be
attacked. This he does in the rear of his own
sector. The model is partially dug in so that
the raiding detachment will have an exact
duplicate of the enemy’s lines to be raided to
practice upon.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_219'>219</span>He now prepares the order for the execution
of the raid, which contains the following points:</p>

<p class='c008'>1. <b>Purpose of the Raid.</b> To destroy such
and such a dugout, machine gun emplacement,
etc., to make prisoners, to gather information,
or to prevent a contemplated gas attack on
the part of the enemy.</p>

<p class='c008'>2. <b>Troops Employed.</b> Number and designation
of the different groups of grenadiers
and trench cleaners to be used, equipment of
same, and ammunition carried.</p>

<p class='c008'>3. <b>Objective of the Raid.</b> The particular
part of a trench, post, blockhouse, etc.</p>

<p class='c008'>4. <b>Precise Rôle of Each Group.</b> Disposition
of the groups before the raid in their own
lines. This may be in the firing line or in
“No Man’s Land” in a shell hole reached by
crawling at night.</p>

<p class='c008'>Time and signal of departure.</p>

<p class='c008'>Means of crossing the enemy’s barbed wire
entanglements.</p>

<p class='c008'>Points of the hostile line upon which each
group is to make its attack.</p>

<p class='c008'>Rôle of each group during the raid. Protection
of the flank, establishing barricades,
proper execution of the raid.</p>

<p class='c008'>Time or signal to return.</p>

<p class='c008'>5. Co-operation of the infantry and artillery
supporting the raid.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_220'>220</span>6. Supply of the attacking troops—grenade
depots in the firing line.</p>

<p class='c008'>In practicing the raid in the rear, on the
model, the detachment must repeat the execution
of the raid at least five times. All the
details of the raid are foreseen and provided
for. Each man is made thoroughly proficient
in his particular part in the raid, so that, in
the confusion and darkness, they will be able
to reach their objective and carry out their
particular function. Each chief of group
must be thoroughly conversant with his duties.
The leader of the raid personally conducts
the most important of these groups.</p>

<p class='c008'><b>Execution of the Raid.</b> The most important
element of the execution of a raid is speed,
its time of duration being only from five to
ten minutes.</p>

<p class='c008'><b>Time.</b> If all the points in the enemy’s line
to be attacked are thoroughly known and
located, the raid can be carried out during the
night. But if there is some lack of knowledge
of the above mentioned points, the raid must
be carried out at dusk or dawn, so that the
objectives can be at least partly seen.</p>

<p class='c008'><b>Disposition of the Groups to Cross the
Barbed Wire; Disposition of the Troops before
the Raid.</b> The distance of a raid should not
be more than fifty yards. For this purpose,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_221'>221</span>the different groups must get into position such
a distance from the enemy’s lines either by
silently crawling across “No Man’s Land” or
by profiting by a short preliminary bombardment
of a few minutes which will prevent
the enemy’s sentinels and watchers from
perceiving them. Their disposition is usually
made by hiding or crouching in shell
holes.</p>

<p class='c008'><b>Destruction of the Barbed Wire.</b> The different
ways of destroying barbed wire have been
spoken of under Surprise Attacks in the chapter
on Defense of a Position.</p>

<p class='c008'><b>Signal of Departure.</b> Three methods can
be used; previous designation of the hour, use
of a whistle, or by means of a rocket. Of
these, the last named is probably the best.</p>

<p class='c008'>There are two different kinds of groups in
the raiding party.</p>

<p class='c008'>The flank groups, armed with hand grenades,
protect the groups executing the raid
proper by shutting off all avenues of approach
of the enemy. Barricades are established by
these groups by throwing grenades into the
trenches leading to the attacked area.</p>

<p class='c008'>Between the flank groups, are the groups
that carry out the proper mission of the raid.
They are armed with incendiary grenades,
pistols, and trench knives. Their function
<span class='pageno' id='Page_222'>222</span>is to accomplish any particular destruction
of their mission and to capture prisoners.</p>

<p class='c008'><b>Infantry Supporting the Raid.</b> The riflemen
of the garrison of the center of resistance
stand ready at the firing parapets to receive
the groups returning from the raid. The
machine guns carry out an intense fire on the
flanks of the point raided to prevent the approach
of hostile reinforcements. The rifle
grenadiers of the garrison execute fire upon
special points on the flanks or on the rear of the
raided area, such as machine gun emplacements,
junction of boyaux, etc.</p>

<p class='c008'><b>Support of the Artillery.</b> If artillery is
used in conjunction with the raid, it may be
employed before, during, or after the raid, or
in any combination of these periods.</p>

<p class='c008'>During the raid, two kinds of fire are carried
out, that of demolishing the barbed wire entanglements,
and special elements of the hostile
position that will hinder the raid. This is
carried out by the light artillery and trench
mortars, principally the latter.</p>

<p class='c008'>During the raid, the support artillery establishes
protective curtains of fire on both
flanks and on the rear of the raided portion of
the enemy’s line. This is to neutralize the
enemy’s defenses and to cut the area off from
communications or reinforcements. In other
<span class='pageno' id='Page_223'>223</span>words, the artillery will isolate by its fire the
point of attack of the raid.</p>

<p class='c008'>At the designated time for the return of the
raid or at the signal of a rocket sent up by the
raiding party on reaching their own first line,
the support artillery establishes its usual defensive
barrage in “No Man’s Land.” It may
also fire on the enemy’s position with shrapnel,
because at this time reinforcements are usually
coming up into the raided area. This latter
fire may be repeated two or three times during
the ensuing hour.</p>

<div class="section"></div>
<h3 class='c013'>II.  Gas Warfare</h3>

<p class='c014'>Gas attacks may be carried out in two ways,
by asphyxiating shells or by waves of gas.</p>

<p class='c008'>The shelling of a position with asphyxiating
shells is made to neutralize the action of its
defenders and, if possible, to kill and wound
some of them. Asphyxiating shells are used
in counter-battery fire against the enemy’s
artillery emplacements. They are also used
for shelling a woods in which troops are located
and against strong points of the hostile position,
either during an offensive period or to
carry out attrition of the enemy. Such shelling
is also carried out for an offensive, either
in the preparation or for the protection of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_224'>224</span>flanks during the attack. Asphyxiating shells
may be thrown on a village or strong point in
rear or on the flank of the enemy’s position
where he may organize a counterattack.</p>

<p class='c008'>Gas waves are used against the enemy’s
position with or without following up with the
infantry for a raid or an attack. Usually the
liquified gas is brought to the first lines in
cylinders under heavy pressure. These cylinders
must be properly protected from hostile
fire until the time that they are to be used.
With a favorable wind, the gas is carried
across “No Man’s Land” and into the enemy’s
position. Gas waves, of course, are more
efficient than asphyxiating shells, but the use
of the former method is more difficult as it
takes special apparatus and a trained personnel,
and can be used only under favorable
atmospheric conditions.</p>

<p class='c008'><b>Protections against Gas.</b> In general, protective
measures against gas waves are the
same as against asphyxiating shells. The
individual protective apparatus is the gas
mask. The essential part of a mask is composed
of several layers of porous material
containing a chemical that will neutralize the
poisonous gas. The gas mask has an efficiency
of several hours. Each man carries a gas
mask and there are also a certain number kept
<span class='pageno' id='Page_225'>225</span>in reserve in the different depots of the sector.
Each gas mask must be properly adjusted and
it is the duty of each officer and non-commissioned
officer to ascertain that each man
in the company has a gas mask in good condition.
He must always carry the same.</p>

<p class='c008'>Each man is trained to put on his mask
rapidly. Standing orders compel the man to
put on his gas mask immediately the alarm is
given or upon his detection of gas by color or
odor. Frequent exercises are held to perfect
the men in putting on their gas masks rapidly.
This drill may be held at the same time as the
“stand to” exercises are carried out. The
men must have confidence in their gas masks.
For this purpose, each man is sent through a
“chlorine chamber” several times to give him
confidence that, although the gas may be of
great density, it has no disagreeable effects.</p>

<p class='c008'>There are also collective protective apparatuses
used in dugouts. Each large shelter
possesses such apparatus. Besides this, the
entrances and openings of each dugout will be
closed by a double canvas impregnated with
a special chemical solution to neutralize the
gas.</p>

<p class='c008'><b>Special Precautionary Measures.</b> First,
there is established a system of bells, sirens,
and klaxons which are used by the watchers
<span class='pageno' id='Page_226'>226</span>to give the signal of alarm. This signal is taken
up and repeated in all parts of the position and
to the rear. Careful observation on the part
of a garrison may detect signs of a coming gas
attack. Metallic noises in the hostile line
may indicate the transportation of gas cylinders.
Very often the enemy will use little
balloons to ascertain the velocity and direction
of the wind. Foggy weather is a special
time of danger.</p>

<p class='c008'>In each sector or regiment, an officer is in
charge of the maintenance of protective gas
apparatus and all the measures against gas
attack. With the proper precautionary measures
and application of the protective measures,
the gas attack is not very dangerous.</p>

<div class="section"></div>
<h3 class='c013'>III. Liquid Fire</h3>

<p class='c014'><b>Protection against Liquid Fire.</b> The enemy
may make an assault with a special detachment
of liquid fire operators in the first
line. The object of these operators is to
throw jets of liquid fire on the occupants of the
first line to allow the assaulting columns to
penetrate into the position without losses.
The only means of combating such an attack
is to evacuate the part of the trenches against
which the liquid fire is directed, and move by
the flanks. Machine guns and automatic rifles
should be established to bring flanking fire to
bear against the detachment of liquid fire
operators. It is impossible to withstand a
liquid fire attack if the operators succeed in
coming within sixty yards before the garrison
can man its parapets.</p>

<h3 class='c013'>IV. Mines</h3>
</div>

<p class='c014'>We will consider mines only from the point
of view of defense by infantry against them.
This consideration will therefore have no
relation to mine warfare or the construction
of countermines by engineers.</p>

<p class='c008'>Let us consider a concrete example where
the enemy is about to explode a mine under
your first line of trenches (examine accompanying
diagram, Precautions against a Mine).
When it has been definitely discovered that
the enemy has a mine gallery under your first
line and there is no means of combating it by
countermining, etc., the infantry in the
position must take certain precautions. By
listening devices the powder chamber is
located. The extent of the crater is also
calculated. A new first line is constructed
behind, excluding the mine crater and at a
distance of about 30 yards from its lip. This
<span class='pageno' id='Page_229'>229</span>re-entrant angle of the first line is made
by using boyaux on the flank if they exist.
A cover trench is also constructed behind
this first line. The infantry moves back
to this new line behind the threatened
area of explosion. Every other defensive
precaution is taken against the explosion
and the accompanying assault of the
enemy.</p>

<p class='c008'>Heavy bombing posts are located on the
flanks of the crater. The position of these
posts is usually at the point of change of
direction of the old firing line with the new
one of the re-entrant angle. Dugouts may be
constructed close to these bombing posts for
the protection of the grenadiers during the
explosion. Immediately the explosion is over,
these grenadiers man their posts and establish
a heavy barricade between the posts and
the crater by using hand grenades. If the
enemy attempts to enter the crater, these
grenadiers can make it untenable by throwing
hand grenades into it.</p>

<p class='c008'>Automatic rifle or machine gun emplacements
are also located on both flanks of the
crater. Their function is to establish flanking
fire on hostile troops attempting to
approach the crater.</p>

<p class='c008'>Rifle grenadiers are stationed in the line of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_230'>230</span>trenches to establish a defensive rifle barrage
out in front of the crater.</p>

<p class='c008'>The riflemen will usually occupy the near
and flank lips of the crater. They will not
occupy the lip of the crater nearest the enemy
until it is ascertained that the enemy has no
more galleries.</p>

<p class='c008'>A rocket post is located in the first line on
the flanks of the crater. As soon as the crater
is exploded, a rocket is sent up from this post
calling upon the artillery for a defensive barrage.
Usually, special artillery is detailed for
this extra fire. It is a reinforced fire, or a
combination of preventive fire and protective
barrage. It is established on the enemy’s
first line rather than in “No Man’s Land”
as a purely defensive barrage.</p>

<p class='c008'>With all these precautions taken, the infantry
await the explosion of the mine.</p>

<h3 class="pg">Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.</p>

<p>Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org.</p>

<h3 class="pg">Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.</p>

<p>The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/donate">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.</p>

<p>While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.</p>

<p>International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.</p>

<p>Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate</p>

<h3 class="pg">Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.</h3>

<p>Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.</p>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.</p>

<p>Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org</p>

<p>This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.</p>
